            "general_llm": "While a definitive answer on how exercise *prevents* Alzheimer's is still being researched, there's growing evidence that it can significantly reduce the risk. \n\nHere's what we know:\n\n* **Brain Health Boost:** Exercise promotes the growth of new brain cells (neurogenesis) and strengthens connections between existing ones (synapses). This helps maintain cognitive function and may protect against the brain changes associated with Alzheimer's.\n\n* **Blood Flow and Oxygen:** Physical activity improves blood circulation, delivering more oxygen and nutrients to the brain. This supports healthy brain function and may help prevent the buildup of harmful proteins linked to Alzheimer's, like amyloid plaques.\n\n* **Inflammation Reduction:** Chronic inflammation is thought to contribute to Alzheimer's development. Exercise has anti-inflammatory effects, which could protect the brain from damage.\n\n* **Insulin Sensitivity:** Exercise improves insulin sensitivity, which may help prevent the buildup of tau tangles, another hallmark of Alzheimer's. \n\n* **Cognitive Reserve:**\n\nRegular exercise helps build cognitive reserve\u2014the brain's resilience to damage. This means that even if some brain cells are lost, the remaining healthy cells can compensate, delaying the onset of noticeable symptoms.\n\n**Types of Exercise:**\n\n* Any type of physical activity is beneficial. Aerobic exercise, like brisk walking, swimming, or cycling, seems particularly effective.\n* Strength training and balance exercises also contribute to overall brain health.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* It's never too late to start exercising.\n* Talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise program, especially if you have health concerns.\n* Consistency is key. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.\n\n\nWhile further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind exercise and Alzheimer's prevention, the existing evidence strongly suggests that physical activity is a valuable tool for protecting brain health.\n",

            "general_llm": "Regular physical exercise has been consistently linked to a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Research suggests that exercise may have several mechanisms by which it could impact the development of Alzheimer's. Here are some potential ways exercise may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease:\n\n1. **Promoting neuroplasticity and brain health**: Exercise stimulates the growth of new neurons and improves communication between brain cells, a process known as neuroplasticity. This can help to build resilience against age-related cognitive decline.\n\n2. **Enhancing cardiovascular health**: Regular exercise improves cardiovascular health by increasing blood flow to the brain and reducing the risk of heart disease, a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week.\n\n3. **Reducing inflammation and oxidative stress**: Exercise has anti-inflammatory effects by stimulating the production of anti-inflammatory proteins and reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It also reduces oxidative stress, which can lead to cellular damage and contribute to Alzheimer's development.\n\n4. **Mimicking cognitive exercise**: Exercise promotes neurotrophic factors (NTFs), such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which stimulates the growth and survival of neurons. NTFs, particularly BDNF, also have a positive impact on memory and learning.\n\n5. **Modulating the gut-brain axis**: Exercise has a profound impact on the gut microbiome, promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and improving the gut barrier function. An imbalance of gut bacteria, often referred to as dysbiosis, has been linked to Alzheimer's risk.\n\n6. **Reducing ApoE4 risk**: Individuals with the APOE4 allele, a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, may benefit from exercise. Physical activity can help to mitigate the increased risk associated with APOE4.\n\nIt is essential to note that the most beneficial effects of exercise on Alzheimer's risk reduction are achieved through regular, long-term engagement. For example, a meta-analysis of seven studies found that regular exercise led to an 11% reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in older adults over the age of 65.\n\nTo maximize the benefits, a combination of aerobic, strength-training, and high-intensity interval training exercises is recommended, along with activities that promote cognitive stimulation and stress reduction. While exercise may not be a magic bullet for preventing Alzheimer's disease, incorporating regular physical activity into one's lifestyle can significantly contribute to a healthier cognitive aging process.",
            "perfect_rag": "Regular physical exercise has been found to potentially reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease by 45%. This is based on a meta-analysis that included 16 studies with more than 160,000 participants. The analysis showed that regular physical activity lowered the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease due to a hazard ratio of 0.55, which translates to a 45% reduction in risk. Furthermore, a sample of 716 older subjects followed for 3.5 years found that individuals with low daily physical activity levels were 53% more likely to develop Alzheimer's Disease than those who reported more active lives, with a hazard ratio of 0.477.",
            "rag_pipeline": "Regular physical exercise is associated with a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. In individuals who exercise regularly, there is a greater likelihood that they will be able to maintain their cognitive abilities. Studies have found that exercise promotes various beneficial changes in brain function that can potentially reduce the risk of developing AD. These benefits include improved amyloid \u03b2 turnover, reduced inflammation, increased synthesis and release of neurotrophins, and enhanced cerebral blood flow. By incorporating physical exercise into their lifestyle, older populations may be able to delay the onset of dementia, with research suggesting that this could even prevent one-third of dementia cases worldwide."

            "general_llm": "Regular physical exercise has been consistently shown to have a positive impact on reducing the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The potential mechanisms underlying this association are multifaceted and involve several key factors.\n\n1. **Improved Cardiovascular Health**: Physical exercise is known to enhance cardiovascular health by reducing blood pressure, improving lipid profiles, and preventing diabetes. Since cardiovascular disease is a significant risk factor for AD, regular exercise may contribute to a lower risk of developing AD by mitigating these vascular risk factors.\n\n2. **Enhanced Cerebral Blood Flow**: Exercise has been demonstrated to increase cerebral blood flow, which is essential for maintaining healthy brain function. Improved blood flow may help to nourish brain cells, reduce inflammation, and clear amyloid-beta plaques, a hallmark of AD pathology.\n\n3. **Neurotrophic Factors and Neurogenesis**: Physical activity stimulates the production of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which play a crucial role in promoting neuronal health, survival, and plasticity. Exercise-induced increases in neurotrophic factors may help to support neurogenesis, the growth of new neurons, and synaptic connectivity, potentially compensating for age-related cognitive decline.\n\n4. **Inflammation Reduction**: Chronic inflammation is a known contributor to AD pathology. Regular exercise has anti-inflammatory effects, which may help to reduce neuroinflammation and mitigate the progression of AD.\n\n5. **Amyloid-Beta Clearance**: Research suggests that physical exercise may enhance the clearance of amyloid-beta plaques from the brain, potentially slowing the progression of AD. This effect may be mediated by improved cerebral blood flow, increased neurotrophic factors, or other exercise-induced mechanisms.\n\n6. **Cognitive Stimulation and Reserve**: Engaging in regular physical exercise often requires cognitive effort, such as learning new movements, navigating environments, or adapting to changing situations. This cognitive stimulation may help to build cognitive reserve, making the brain more resilient to age-related cognitive decline and potentially reducing the risk of AD.\n\n7. **Hormonal and Metabolic Changes**: Exercise influences various hormonal and metabolic pathways, including insulin signaling, glucose metabolism, and stress hormone regulation. These changes may help to reduce the risk of AD by promoting a more favorable metabolic and hormonal environment.\n\nWhile the exact mechanisms are not yet fully understood, the cumulative evidence suggests that regular physical exercise has a positive impact on reducing the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease. The American Heart Association and other health organizations recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, or a combination of both, per week, to promote overall health and potentially reduce the risk of AD. However, it is essential to note that individual results may vary, and more research is needed to fully elucidate the relationship between physical exercise and AD risk reduction.",
            "perfect_rag": "Regular physical exercise has been found to potentially reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by approximately 45%. This is based on a meta-analysis of 16 studies involving over 160,000 participants, which showed a significant reduction in the risk of developing AD among individuals who engaged in regular physical activity. Additionally, a study of 716 older subjects found that those with low daily physical activity levels were 53% more likely to develop AD compared to those who reported more active lives.\n\nThe benefits of physical exercise in reducing the risk of AD are thought to be applicable to both healthy individuals and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In individuals with MCI, physical activity has been shown to improve executive functions, memory, and cognitive test performance, which can help prevent the progression of the disease. Furthermore, in individuals diagnosed with AD, aerobic exercise, either alone or combined with cognitive stimulation, has been found to induce improvements in certain aspects of brain function, particularly in the early stages of the disease.\n\nWhile the exact mechanisms by which physical exercise reduces the risk of AD are not fully understood, it is believed that a combination of lifestyle factors, including physical activity, diet, and cognitive training, may be more effective in preventing or delaying the onset of AD than any single factor alone. Engaging in physical exercise as part of a multimodal intervention, which addresses multiple risk factors for AD, may therefore be a key strategy for reducing the risk of developing the disease.",

Exercise, including both aerobic and resistance training, appears to have a protective effect on brain function. It may help regulate amyloid \u03b2 turnover, which is a protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, exercise has anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce inflammation in the brain. Physical activity also promotes the synthesis and release of neurotrophins, which are essential for healthy brain function. Furthermore, exercise can improve cerebral blood flow, providing the brain with a more efficient supply of oxygen and nutrients. By promoting these changes, regular physical exercise may help maintain cognition in older adults and potentially delay the onset of dementia. In fact, adopting an active lifestyle, as part of a multimodal intervention, may have the potential to delay up to one-third of dementias worldwide, suggesting that exercise plays a crucial role in reducing the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease."

            "general_llm": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking how regular physical exercise can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's. Let me start by recalling what I know about this.\n\nFirst, I remember that exercise is often recommended for overall brain health. But what specific mechanisms are involved here? There's probably something related to blood flow and the brain. I've heard terms like neurogenesis and BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) before. Maybe exercise increases BDNF, which supports the survival of neurons and promotes the growth of new ones. That makes sense because the hippocampus is involved in memory and is affected in Alzheimer's.\n\nAlso, exercise improves cardiovascular health. Since Alzheimer's is linked to vascular issues, better blood flow and reduced risk of hypertension, diabetes, or obesity could be factors. These conditions are known risk factors for Alzheimer's. So exercise might mitigate those risks.\n\nThen there's the aspect of inflammation. Chronic inflammation in the brain is associated with Alzheimer's, and exercise might reduce systemic inflammation. Studies have shown that physical activity reduces inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein. That could help in preventing neuroinflammation.\n\nAnother point is the clearance of amyloid-beta plaques. I think exercise might enhance the body's ability to clear these plaques through the lymphatic system or other mechanisms. The glymphatic system is involved in waste removal in the brain, and maybe exercise stimulates that process.\n\nMental health factors like stress reduction and better sleep also play a role. Chronic stress and poor sleep are linked to higher Alzheimer's risk. Exercise can reduce stress hormones like cortisol and improve sleep quality, which in turn supports brain health.\n\nCognitive reserve is another concept. Regular physical activity might increase cognitive reserve by promoting the formation of new neural connections. Even if plaques form, a stronger network could compensate for some damage. But wait, the user specifically asked about reducing risk, not just delaying onset. So cognitive reserve is more about coping with existing pathology, while the other points address preventing the pathology itself.\n\nI need to make sure the answer is comprehensive but not redundant. Let me check if I missed any mechanisms. There's also the aspect of vascular benefits\u2014exercise promotes angiogenesis, creating new blood vessels, ensuring better oxygen and nutrient supply. Also, insulin resistance is a factor in Alzheimer's; exercise improves insulin sensitivity, which might reduce beta-amyloid production.\n\nI should structure the answer to cover these points clearly. Start with enhancing neuroplasticity through BDNF and neurogenesis. Then talk about vascular health and circulation. Next, inflammation reduction. Amyloid-beta clearance might be a separate point. Mental health and sleep factors. Insulin sensitivity. Maybe also include lifestyle factors like better diet adherence in conjunction with exercise. But since the question is about exercise specifically, focus on that.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for potential ways exercise reduces risk, so I need to present established mechanisms. I should avoid speculating. Make sure each point is backed by medical knowledge. For example, the hippocampus and BDNF are well-supported. The link between exercise and increased HDL cholesterol, which is involved in amyloid clearance. Also, the role of autophagy\u2014exercise might induce autophagy, which helps in clearing out damaged cells. But I'm not sure about that. Maybe not that one.\n\nAlso, social interaction during exercise could contribute, but again, the question is about the exercise itself, not the social aspect. So maybe leave that out unless it's direct.\n\nI need to ensure the answer is accurate and cites the mechanisms properly. Let me organize the points in a logical flow and make sure each is fact-based.\n</think>\n\nRegular physical exercise has been shown to potentially reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease through multiple interconnected mechanisms, each contributing to brain health and resilience. Below is a detailed breakdown of these mechanisms, supported by established scientific findings:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Enhanced Neuroplasticity and Neurogenesis**  \n   - **BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor):** Exercise stimulates the production of BDNF, a protein that supports the survival of existing neurons and encourages the growth and differentiation of new neurons (neurogenesis) and synapses (neuroplasticity). This is particularly critical in the hippocampus, a brain region heavily involved in memory and often affected in Alzheimer\u2019s.  \n   - **Stem Cell Activity:** Physical activity increases the proliferation of neural stem cells in the hippocampus, promoting the integration of new neurons into existing brain networks, which may help offset age-related cognitive decline.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Improved Cerebral Blood Flow and Vascular Health**  \n   - **Angiogenesis:** Exercise promotes the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and enhances capillary density in the brain, improving oxygen and nutrient supply to brain tissue.  \n   - **Reduced Vascular Risk Factors:** Regular physical activity lowers risks for hypertension, diabetes, and obesity\u2014conditions linked to vascular damage and increased Alzheimer\u2019s risk. Improved cardiovascular health reduces the likelihood of amyloid buildup in small blood vessels (cerebral amyloid angiopathy), a contributing factor to Alzheimer\u2019s pathology.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Amyloid-\u03b2 Clearance and Metabolism**  \n   - **Glymphatic System Stimulation:** Exercise may enhance the function of the glymphatic system, a brain-wide waste clearance pathway active during sleep. This system removes toxic proteins like amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s.  \n   - **Amyloid-\u03b2 Metabolism:** Studies in animal models show that exercise increases the expression of enzymes (e.g., neprilysin) that break down A\u03b2, reducing its accumulation in the brain.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Reduction in Systemic and Neuroinflammation**  \n   - **Anti-Inflammatory Effects:** Exercise lowers systemic inflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-alpha) and increasing anti-inflammatory mediators. Chronic inflammation in the brain contributes to neuronal damage in Alzheimer\u2019s.  \n   - **Microglial Activation:** Physical activity may modulate microglial (immune cell) function, promoting their clearance of pathological debris while reducing harmful inflammatory responses.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Insulin Sensitivity and Glucose Metabolism**  \n   - **Reduced Insulin Resistance:** Exercise enhances insulin sensitivity, lowering the risk of type 2 diabetes, a recognized Alzheimer\u2019s risk factor. Insulin resistance impairs glucose uptake in the brain, leading to energy deficits and impaired neuronal function.  \n   - **Amyloid Metabolism and Tau Pathology:** Insulin plays a role in regulating amyloid-\u03b2 and tau proteins; improved insulin signaling may reduce their abnormal accumulation.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Stress Reduction and Sleep Improvement**  \n   - **Lower Cortisol Levels:** Exercise reduces stress hormones like cortisol, which, when chronically elevated, impair hippocampal function and increase A\u03b2 production.  \n   - **Sleep Quality:** Physical activity promotes deeper, more restorative sleep, which is critical for glymphatic activity during the slow-wave sleep phase. Poor sleep disrupts amyloid clearance and increases Alzheimer\u2019s risk.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Cognitive Reserve and Behavioral Factors**  \n   - **Cognitive Reserve:** Regular exercise may strengthen neural networks, building a \u201ccognitive reserve\u201d that allows the brain to compensate for pathological changes.  \n   - **Lifestyle Synergy:** Exercise often accompanies healthier habits (e.g., better diet, reduced smoking/alcohol use), further reducing Alzheimer\u2019s risk. Mental engagement during certain activities (e.g., dancing, team sports) may also provide cognitive benefits.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Mitochondrial Function and Oxidative Stress**  \n   - **Enhanced Mitochondrial Efficiency:** Exercise boosts mitochondrial biogenesis, improving energy production and reducing oxidative stress. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage are key contributors to Alzheimer\u2019s pathology.\n\n---\n\n### Evidence and Recommendations  \nPopulation-based studies consistently associate higher physical activity levels with a **30\u201340% lower risk** of Alzheimer\u2019s. The **World Health Organization** recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise weekly for adults, emphasizing that even mild activity (e.g., walking) can be beneficial when performed regularly.\n\n---\n\n### Limitations and Considerations  \nWhile exercise is a modifiable risk factor, its effects vary based on genetics, age, and overall health. Exercise should complement\u2014not replace\u2014other Alzheimer\u2019s prevention strategies (e.g., a balanced diet, cognitive engagement, and social interaction).\n\nIn summary, physical exercise reduces Alzheimer\u2019s risk by targeting multiple biological pathways\u2014including neuroplasticity, vascular health, inflammation, metabolic regulation, and waste clearance\u2014making it a cornerstone of brain-healthy aging.",
            "perfect_rag": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking how regular physical exercise can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's. I need to refer to the context provided.\n\nFirst, the context mentions a meta-analysis with 16 studies showing a 45% reduction in AD risk with regular physical activity. The hazard ratio is 0.55, so that's a significant number. Another study with 716 participants found that low activity levels increased risk by 53%. So physical exercise seems to cut the risk quite a bit.\n\nThen there's something about people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and how aerobic exercise improves executive functions, memory, and cognitive tests. This is important because preventing MCI from progressing to AD is a key point. For those already with AD, aerobic exercise along with cognitive stimulation helps brain function. Resistance training also has benefits, like improving memory and attention in MCI patients even a year later. \n\nThe context also talks about multimodal interventions combining diet, exercise, and cognitive training. Studies like the Finnish FINGER trial show that these combined approaches work better. But the question is specifically about physical exercise. \n\nSo I need to focus on the mechanisms or the evidence showing exercise's direct impact. The meta-analyses are key here. Also, maybe the fact that exercise addresses multiple risk factors like obesity, hypertension, which are mentioned as contributors to dementia. \n\nBut the user isn't asking about risk factors, just how exercise reduces risk. So the main points are the statistical evidence from studies, the improvements in cognitive functions in at-risk populations, and maybe the persistence of benefits even after stopping exercise. Also, resistance training and aerobic both contribute. \n\nI should structure the answer by mentioning the reduction in risk from meta-analysis, the longitudinal study showing higher risk with low activity, then mention the benefits in MCI and early AD patients. Also note that resistance training has shown positive results. Avoid going into multimodal unless necessary, but since the question is about exercise itself, stick to that. \n\nWait, the user is asking about how it reduces risk, so maybe not all the mechanisms are known, but the evidence shows lower incidence. The context says physical activity is a risk factor in the 9% list, so addressing that reduces dementia, which is 35% attributable. So by improving those factors, exercise helps. But the direct evidence from studies is that active people have lower incidence. \n\nSo the answer should combine the statistical data from the studies provided and link regular exercise to lower hazard ratios. Also mention that even after intervention stops, benefits persist, showing long-term effects. That's from the resistance study where benefits lasted 12 months post-intervention. \n\nI need to make sure not to include other parts like diet unless relevant. The user's question is specifically about physical exercise. So the main points are: meta-analysis shows 45% reduction, another study 53% higher risk for inactive, improvements in cognitive functions for MCI/AD, and sustained benefits from exercise programs. Also, note that exercise addresses several risk factors (obesity, hypertension, etc.) but that's more indirect. The context also mentions that multimodal is more effective, but the question is about physical exercise alone here. \n\nSo the answer should be structured to first state the reduction in risk from the meta-analysis, then the longitudinal study, then mention the effectiveness in MCI/AD populations, and resistance training benefits. Avoid the part about multimodal interventions unless it's to say that exercise is part of them but the question is about exercise alone.\n</think>\n\nRegular physical exercise reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) through evidence-based associations demonstrated in multiple studies. A meta-analysis of 16 studies involving over 160,000 participants revealed that regular physical activity lowers AD risk by 45% (hazard ratio = 0.55). Similarly, a longitudinal study of 716 older adults found that individuals with low daily physical activity levels had a 53% higher risk of developing AD compared to more active counterparts (hazard ratio = 0.477). \n\nPhysical activity also benefits those already at risk. In individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), aerobic exercise improves memory, executive function, and cognitive test performance, which may delay progression to AD. For people with early-stage AD, aerobic exercise\u2014alone or combined with cognitive training\u2014has been linked to improvements in brain function. Resistance training further contributes, with a randomized trial showing sustained cognitive benefits (e.g., enhanced memory and attention) in older adults with MCI up to 12 months after a 6-month program. \n\nThese effects may stem from exercise's role in mitigating known AD risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, and vascular issues, while promoting brain health. Collectively, the evidence underscores physical exercise as a potent, accessible strategy to lower AD risk and support cognitive resilience.",
            "rag_pipeline": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking how regular physical exercise reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Let me look through the context provided to find the relevant information. \n\nFirst, the context mentions that a low level of physical activity is a risk factor for AD. So, exercising more could mitigate that. Then, it talks about physical exercise's role in modulating several mechanisms like amyloid \u03b2 turnover. I remember from the context that amyloid plaques are a key feature of AD. So exercise might help clear those plaques.\n\nAlso, physical activity influences inflammation. Chronic inflammation is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, so reducing it through exercise could be another pathway. Then there's neurotrophins, like neurotrophins, which support neuron growth. The context says exercise increases their synthesis and release, which should help in maintaining cognitive function.\n\nCerebral blood flow improvement is another point. Better blood flow means more nutrients and oxygen to the brain, which is essential for function and preventing degradation. The context also mentions that older adults who exercise maintain cognition better. \n\nAdditionally, the review talks about lifestyle changes in presymptomatic stages delaying dementias by a third. So, incorporating exercise early on can have preventative benefits. The multimodal approach including active lifestyles is recommended for older populations.\n\nPutting this all together: exercise reduces AD risk through multiple mechanisms\u2014amyloid \u03b2 modulation, reducing inflammation, enhancing neurotrophins, improving blood flow, and promoting cognitive maintenance. The answer should list these factors based on the context without adding external info or verbatim quotes. Make sure each point is clear and connects back to the question.\n</think>\n\nRegular physical exercise reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease through several key mechanisms. Evidence suggests that physical activity modulates amyloid \u03b2 turnover, a hallmark protein involved in Alzheimer's pathology, by potentially reducing its accumulation in the brain. Exercise also decreases neuroinflammation, a process linked to neuronal damage and cognitive decline. Additionally, it stimulates the synthesis and release of neurotrophic factors like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which support neuronal survival, plasticity, and synaptic function. Physical activity improves cerebral blood flow, enhancing oxygen and nutrient delivery to brain regions critical for memory and cognition, such as the hippocampus. These combined effects help preserve cognitive function in older adults and may delay the onset of Alzheimer's by promoting overall brain resilience. Furthermore, adopting an active lifestyle early, even in presymptomatic or predementia stages, can contribute to preventing up to one-third of dementia cases globally."
