COMPLETENESS_PROMPT='You are a medical expert evaluating the COMPLETENESS of a response to a query about Alzheimer\'s Disease.

**COMPLETENESS** refers to how thoroughly the response addresses all major aspects or implications of the query. Key components include relevant subtopics, clinical factors, or facts expected in a medically comprehensive answer.

The response does **not** need to reproduce the essential elements word-for-word. However, it **must meaningfully address** all the concepts they represent — rewording is acceptable, but omission of key ideas is not.

Rate the response on a scale from 1 to 5:
- 1: Does not address the query topic at all.
- 2: Briefly addresses the topic but misses many important components.
- 3: Addresses the topic but misses 2–3 key components.
- 4: Thoroughly addresses the topic with only 1 minor component missing.
- 5: Fully addresses all relevant aspects of the query.

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object. Do NOT include markdown formatting, explanations, or extra text.

Use this format exactly:
{"score": 1|2|3|4|5, "reasoning": "Maximum of three sentences giving reasoning to the score."}

Keep the reasoning concise and limited to **3 sentences or fewer**. Exceeding this limit will result in a penalty.
