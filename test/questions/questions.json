Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases.\n\nLearn more: What is the Difference Between Dementia and Alzheimer's?, What is Dementia, Research and Progress\n\nAlzheimer's is not a normal part of aging. The greatest known risk factor is increasing age, and the majority of people with Alzheimer's are 65 and older. Alzheimer's disease is considered to be younger-onset Alzheimer's if it affects a person under 65. Younger-onset can also be referred to as early-onset Alzheimer's. People with younger-onset Alzheimer's can be in the early, middle or late stage of the disease.\n\nLearn more: Younger/Early-Onset Alzheimer's, Causes and Risk Factors \n\u200b\nAlzheimer's worsens over time. Alzheimer's is a progressive disease, where dementia symptoms gradually worsen over a number of years. In its early stages, memory loss is mild, but with late-stage Alzheimer's, individuals lose the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment. On average, a person with Alzheimer's lives four to eight years after diagnosis but can live as long as 20 years, depending on other factors.\n\nLearn more: 10 Warning Signs, Stages of Alzheimer's Disease\n\n## Alzheimer's as a continuum\n\nAlzheimer's disease progresses in stages, with the severity of symptoms increasing over time.\n\nSelect a stage to learn more.\n\nAlzheimer's has no cure, but two treatments \u2014 donanemab (Kisunla\u2122) and lecanemab (Leqembi\u00ae) \u2014 demonstrate that removing beta-amyloid, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, from the brain reduces cognitive and functional decline in people living with early Alzheimer's. Other treatments can temporarily slow the worsening of dementia symptoms and improve quality of life for those with living Alzheimer's and their caregivers. Today, there is a worldwide effort underway to find better ways to treat the disease, delay its onset and prevent it from developing.\n\nLearn more: Treatments, Treatment Horizon, Prevention, Clinical Trials\n\n## Symptoms of Alzheimer's\n\nThe most common early symptom of Alzheimer's is difficulty remembering newly learned information.\n\r\nJust like the rest of our bodies, our brains change as we age. Most of us eventually notice some slowed thinking and occasional problems with remembering certain things. However, serious memory loss, confusion and other major changes in the way our minds work may be a sign that brain cells are failing.\n\r\nAlzheimer's changes typically begin in the part of the brain that affects learning. As Alzheimer's advances through the brain it leads to increasingly severe symptoms, including disorientation, mood and behavior changes; deepening confusion about events, time and place; unfounded suspicions about family, friends and professional caregivers; more serious memory loss and behavior changes; and difficulty speaking, swallowing and walking.\n\nPeople with memory loss or other possible signs of Alzheimer's may find it hard to recognize they have a problem. Signs of dementia may be more obvious to family members or friends. Anyone experiencing dementia-like symptoms should see a doctor as soon as possible. If you need assistance finding a doctor with experience evaluating memory problems, your local Alzheimer's Association can help. Earlier diagnosis and intervention methods are improving dramatically, and treatment options and sources of support can improve quality of life. Two helpful support resources you can tap into are ALZConnected, our message boards and online social networking community, and ALZNavigator\u2122, a web tool that creates customized action plans, based on answers you provide through short, online surveys.\n\nTake our free, online education courses: Understanding Alzheimer's and Dementia and Know the 10 Signs: Early Detection Matters\n\n## Alzheimer's is not the only cause of memory loss\n\nMany people have trouble with memory \u2014 this does NOT mean they have Alzheimer's. There are many different causes of memory loss. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of dementia, it is best to visit a doctor so the cause can be determined.\n\n## Alzheimer's and the brain\n\nMicroscopic changes in the brain begin long before the first signs of memory loss.\n\nThe brain has 100 billion nerve cells (neurons). Each nerve cell connects with many others to form communication networks. Groups of nerve cells have special jobs. Some are involved in thinking, learning and remembering. Others help us see, hear and smell.\n\nTo do their work, brain cells operate like tiny factories. They receive supplies, generate energy, construct equipment and get rid of waste. Cells also process and store information and communicate with other cells. Keeping everything running requires coordination as well as large amounts of fuel and oxygen.\n\nScientists believe Alzheimer's disease prevents parts of a cell's factory from running well. They are not sure where the trouble starts. But just like a real factory, backups and breakdowns in one system cause problems in other areas. As damage spreads, cells lose their ability to do their jobs and, eventually die, causing irreversible changes in the brain.\n\n## The role of plaques and tangles\n\nTwo abnormal structures called plaques and tangles are prime suspects in damaging and killing nerve cells.\n\nPlaques are deposits of a protein fragment called beta-amyloid (BAY-tuh AM-uh-loyd) that build up in the spaces between nerve cells.\n\nTangles are twisted fibers of another protein called tau (rhymes with \"wow\") that build up inside cells.\n\nThough autopsy studies show that most people develop some plaques and tangles as they age, those with Alzheimer's tend to develop far more and in a predictable pattern, beginning in the areas important for memory before spreading to other regions.\n\nScientists do not know exactly what role plaques and tangles play in Alzheimer's disease. Most experts believe they somehow play a critical role in blocking communication among nerve cells and disrupting processes that cells need to survive.\n\nIt's the destruction and death of nerve cells that causes memory failure, personality changes, problems carrying out daily activities and other symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.\n\r\nLearn More: Take the Brain Tour\n\n## Research and progress\n\nIn 1906, German physician Dr. Alois Alzheimer first described \"a peculiar disease\" \u2014 one of profound memory loss and microscopic brain changes \u2014 a disease we now know as Alzheimer's.\n\r\nToday, Alzheimer's is at the forefront of biomedical research. Researchers are working to uncover as many aspects of Alzheimer's and other dementias as possible. Some of the most remarkable progress has shed light on how Alzheimer's affects the brain. The hope is this better understanding will lead to new treatments. Many potential approaches are currently under investigation worldwide.

            "## Overview\n\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the biological process that begins with the appearance of a buildup of proteins in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. This causes brain cells to die over time and the brain to shrink.\n\nAbout 6.9 million people in the United States age 65 and older live with Alzheimer's disease. Among them, more than 70% are age 75 and older. Of the more than 55 million people in the world with dementia, 60% to 70% are estimated to have Alzheimer's disease.\n\nEarly symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include forgetting recent events or conversations. Over time, Alzheimer's disease leads to serious memory loss and affects a person's ability to do everyday tasks.\n\nThere is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. In advanced stages, loss of brain function can cause dehydration, poor nutrition or infection. These complications can result in death.\n\nBut medicines may improve symptoms or slow the decline in thinking. Programs and services can help support people with the disease and their caregivers."

            "# Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)\n\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of memory loss or other cognitive ability loss (such as language or visual/spatial perception) in individuals who maintain the ability to independently perform most activities of daily living.\n\nAbout\n\nSymptoms\n\nDiagnosis\n\nCauses and risks\n\nTreatments\n\nSpecial report on MCI\n\n## About mild cognitive impairment\n\nMild cognitive impairment causes cognitive changes that are serious enough to be noticed by the person affected and by family members and friends but do not affect the individual\u2019s ability to carry out everyday activities.\n\r\nMCI can develop for multiple reasons, and individuals living with MCI may go on to develop dementia; others will not. For neurodegenerative diseases, MCI can be an early stage of the disease continuum including for Alzheimer's if the hallmark changes in the brain are present.\n\r\nIn some individuals, MCI reverts to normal cognition or remains stable. In other cases, such as when a medication causes cognitive impairment, MCI is mistakenly diagnosed. It is important that people experiencing cognitive changes seek help as soon as possible for diagnosis and possible treatment.\n\nLearn more: Types of Dementia, What Is Alzheimer's?, Alzheimer's Causes and Risk Factors\n\n## Symptoms\n\nAmnestic MCI: MCI that primarily affects memory. A person may start to forget important information that he or she would previously have recalled easily, such as appointments, conversations or recent events.\n\nNonamnestic MCI: MCI that affects thinking skills other than memory, including the ability to make sound decisions, judge the time or sequence of steps needed to complete a complex task, or visual perception.\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nMild cognitive impairment is a clinical diagnosis representing a doctor's best professional judgment about the reason for a person's symptoms. Individuals living with MCI who have an abnormal brain positron emission tomography (PET) scan or spinal fluid test for amyloid beta protein, which is the protein in amyloid plaques (one of the two hallmarks of Alzheimer's), are considered to have a diagnosis of MCI due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\r\nThe Alzheimer's Association partnered with the National Institute on Aging (NIA) to convene expert workgroups to update the diagnostic guidelines for MCI due to Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that, in some cases, MCI is an early stage of Alzheimer\u2019s or another dementia.\n\r\nThe guidelines recommend finding a biomarker (a measurable biological factor, such as levels of a protein, that indicates the presence or absence of a disease) for people with MCI to learn whether they have brain changes that put them at high risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias.\n\r\nIf it can be shown that changes in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and/or blood are caused by physiologic processes associated with Alzheimer\u2019s, the revised guidelines recommend a diagnosis of MCI due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\r\nA medical workup for MCI includes the following core elements:\n\nThorough medical history, where the physician documents current symptoms, previous illnesses and medical conditions, and any family history of significant memory problems or dementia.\n\nAssessment of independent function and daily activities, which focuses on any changes from a person's usual level of function.\n\nInput from a family member or trusted friend to provide additional perspective on how function may have changed.\n\nAssessment of mental status using brief tests designed to evaluate memory, planning, judgment, ability to understand visual information and other key thinking skills.\n\nIn-office neurological examination to assess the function of nerves and reflexes, movement, coordination, balance and senses.\n\nEvaluation of mood to detect depression; symptoms may include problems with memory or feeling \"foggy.\" Depression is widespread and may be especially common in older adults.\n\nLaboratory tests including blood tests and imaging of the brain's structure.\n\nIf the workup doesn't create a clear clinical picture, the doctor may recommend neuropsychological testing, which involves a series of written or computerized tests to evaluate specific thinking skills.\n\n## Causes and risks\n\nThe causes of MCI are not yet completely understood. Experts believe that many cases \u2014 but not all \u2014 result from brain changes occurring in the very early stages of Alzheimer's or other neurodegenerative diseases that cause dementia.\n\r\nThe risk factors most strongly linked to MCI when the underlying cause is neurodegenerative disease and not another cause are advancing age, family history of Alzheimer's or another dementia, and conditions that raise risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\r\nLearn more: Dementia Risk and Prevention\n\n## Treatments and outcomes\n\nDonanemab (Kisunla\u2122) and lecanemab (Leqembi\u00ae) have received traditional approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThese therapies address the underlying biology of Alzheimer\u2019s and slow disease progression. They demonstrate that removing beta-amyloid plaques, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s, from the brain results in a reduction in clinical decline with benefits to both cognition and function in people living with the disease.\n\r\nMore research is needed on the biological changes associated with normal aging, MCI and Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias to better understand the causes of and risk factors for MCI and the prognosis for those with the condition.\n\r\nIndividuals who have been diagnosed with MCI should be reevaluated every six months to determine if symptoms have progressed.\n\r\nStay informed about research investigating MCI, Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias. Sign up for E-News today.\n\r\nLearn more: Earlier Diagnosis\n\n## Special report on MCI\n\nThe 2022 edition of Alzheimer\u2019s Association Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Facts and Figures featured a special report, More Than Normal Aging: Understanding Mild Cognitive Impairment, that examined the challenges physicians and the American public face in understanding and diagnosing MCI.\n\r\nAmong the facts:\n\nApproximately 12% to 18% of people age 60 or older are living with MCI.\n\nAn estimated 10% to 15% of individuals living with MCI develop dementia each year.\n\nAbout one-third of people living with MCI due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease develop dementia within five years.\n\nForty-two percent of Americans say they worry about developing MCI due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nMore than 80% of Americans know little or are not familiar with MCI, which can be an early stage of Alzheimer's."

However, not all people with MCI develop dementia.\n\n## Early-stage Alzheimer's (mild)\n\nIn the early stage of Alzheimer's, a person may function independently. He or she may still drive, work and be part of social activities. Despite this, the person may feel as if he or she is having memory lapses, such as forgetting familiar words or the location of everyday objects.\n\nSymptoms may not be widely apparent at this stage, but family and close friends may take notice and a doctor would be able to identify symptoms using certain diagnostic tools.\n\r\nCommon difficulties include:\n\nComing up with the right word or name.\n\nRemembering names when introduced to new people.\n\nHaving difficulty performing tasks in social or work settings.\n\nForgetting material that was just read.\n\nLosing or misplacing a valuable object.\n\nExperiencing increased trouble with planning or organizing.\u200b\r\n\t\n\nYou can live well\n\nDuring the early stage, it\u2019s possible for people with dementia to live well by taking control of their health and wellness, and focusing their energy on aspects of their life that are most meaningful to them.

As the disease progresses, the person with Alzheimer's will require a greater level of care.\n\r\nDuring the middle stage of Alzheimer\u2019s, the dementia symptoms are more pronounced. The person may confuse words, get frustrated or angry, and act in unexpected ways, such as refusing to bathe. Damage to nerve cells in the brain can also make it difficult for the person to express thoughts and perform routine tasks without assistance.\n\n## Home Safety Checklist\n\nDownload, print and keep the checklist handy to prevent dangerous situations and help maximize the person living with dementia's independence for as long as possible.\n\nSymptoms, which vary from person to person, may include:\n\nBeing forgetful of events or personal history.\n\n\u200bFeeling moody or withdrawn, especially in socially or mentally challenging situations.\n\nBeing unable to recall information about themselves like their address or telephone number, and the high school or college they attended.\n\nExperiencing confusion about where they are or what day it is.\n\nRequiring help choosing proper clothing for the season or the occasion.\n\nHaving trouble controlling their bladder and bowels.\n\nExperiencing changes in sleep patterns, such as sleeping during the day and becoming restless at night.\n\nShowing an increased tendency to wander and become lost.\n\nDemonstrating personality and behavioral changes, including suspiciousness and delusions or compulsive, repetitive behavior like hand-wringing or tissue shredding.\n\nIn the middle stage, the person living with Alzheimer\u2019s can still participate in daily activities with assistance. It\u2019s important to find out what the person can still do or find ways to simplify tasks.

            "# What is the difference between vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease?\n\nVascular dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease are two types of dementia. Both conditions can affect cognitive function, behavior, and the ability to carry out everyday tasks.\n\nVascular dementia occurs as a result of damage to the blood vessels in the brain that affect brain function. The condition can affect thinking, behavior, and memory.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease occurs through the formation of amyloid plaques and tangles of fibers in the brain. These changes affect memory, thinking, and the ability to carry out everyday activities.\n\nMany symptoms and risk factors for vascular dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease overlap. It is possible for people to have both Alzheimer\u2019s disease and vascular dementia. Healthcare professionals refer to this as mixed dementia.\n\nThis article compares vascular dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n## What is vascular dementia?\n\nVascular dementia is the term for any changes in cognition or brain function that occur from damage to the blood vessels in the brain. The condition affects memory, thinking, and behavior.\n\nIt develops as a result of conditions that affect the blood flow to the brain, such as a stroke. A lack of blood flow and oxygen to the brain can damage the blood vessels in the brain.\n\nChanges in cognitive function can depend on the severity of the damage and which region of the brain vascular changes affect.\n\nSymptoms of vascular dementia include:\n\ndifficulty performing everyday tasks\n\ndifficulty following instructions or taking in new information\n\nforgetting past or current events\n\nmisplacing items\n\ngetting lost in familiar places or routes\n\nlanguage problems, such as difficulty finding the right words\n\ndifficulty reading and writing\n\nchanges in sleeping patterns\n\nmood or personality changes, such as feeling depressed, angry, or agitated\n\nlosing interest in people or hobbies\n\nhallucinations or delusions\n\na lack of judgment and inability to perceive danger\n\n## What is Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common type of dementia in older adults (ages 65 years and over). It affects thinking skills, memory, and the ability to carry out everyday tasks.\n\nThe symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease happen due to changes in the brain. A buildup of proteins forms plaques, called amyloid plaques, and tangles of fibers, called tau tangles. Neurons, which send messages between areas of the brain, stop working correctly and cannot connect with other neurons.\n\nSymptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease can occur in stages, which may be mild to begin with and gradually worsen over time. They can include:\n\nmemory problems\n\ndifficulty finding words\n\nimpaired reasoning or judgment\n\nwandering and getting lost\n\ndifficulty with everyday tasks, such as paying bills and handling money\n\npersonality and behavioral changes\n\nrepeating questions\n\nconfusion\n\ndifficulty recognizing friends and family\n\ndifficulty coping with new situations or learning new information\n\nhallucinations, delusions, or paranoia\n\nimpulsive behavior\n\nbeing unable to communicate or care for themselves\n\n## Similarities and differences\n\nThe following are similarities and differences between the two types of dementia.\n\n### Causes\n\nAccording to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, both vascular dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease have connections with conditions that damage the blood vessels and heart. These include:\n\nheart disease\n\nstroke\n\ndiabetes\n\nhigh blood pressure\n\nhigh cholesterol\n\nBlood vessel and heart health are important for brain health, as these supply blood and oxygen to the brain. Damage to the heart and blood vessels may increase the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and vascular dementia.\n\nStroke, or damage to blood vessels in the brain, may increase the likelihood of plaques and tangles, leading to symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n### Symptoms\n\nDepending on where vascular changes occur, symptoms of both conditions may overlap.\n\nIf vascular dementia occurs after a stroke, changes in thinking and behavior may occur very suddenly. If damage to blood vessels happens deeper within the brain, cognitive changes may occur more gradually.\n\nEarly symptoms of vascular dementia may include:\n\nconfusion\n\nimpaired judgment\n\ndifficulty speaking\n\nphysical symptoms of a stroke, such as paralysis or numbness on one side of the body\n\nDepending on where damage occurs, memory loss may or may not be a key symptom of vascular dementia.\n\nIf changes occur in the area of the brain that helps store and retrieve information, people with vascular dementia may experience memory loss similar to that typically seen in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms typically begin with memory loss, which may worsen over time.\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nTo diagnose vascular dementia, a doctor may carry out a range of tests and investigations, including:\n\nassessing symptoms and a person\u2019s medical history and lifestyle\n\nasking the person, or people who know the person well, about changes in their everyday behavior and ability to carry out everyday activities\n\ntests to assess memory and thinking skills\n\nbrain imaging scans\n\nTo diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s disease, doctors may carry out a variety of examinations, such as:\n\ntaking a full medical history and assessing symptoms\n\nasking the person and their friends or family about:overall healththe person\u2019s ability to carry out everyday tasksany changes in their personality or behavior\n\noverall health\n\nthe person\u2019s ability to carry out everyday tasks\n\nany changes in their personality or behavior\n\ntests to check memory and attention, problem solving, counting, and language skills\n\nblood and urine tests to rule out other conditions\n\nMRI, CT, or PET scans to provide images of the brain\n\n## Risk factors\n\nFactors that may increase the risk of vascular dementia include:\n\nhigh blood pressure\n\nconditions affecting the typical rhythm of the heartbeat\n\ndiabetes\n\nhigh cholesterol\n\nManaging risk factors may reduce the risk of developing dementia.\n\nAlthough strokes increase the risk of vascular dementia, not everyone who experiences a stroke will develop dementia.\n\nA combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors may cause Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Risk factors for Alzheimer\u2019s disease include:\n\ngenetics, including having a certain gene that is a type of apolipoprotein E gene\n\nbeing an older adult\n\na family history of Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\nhead injury\n\nheart disease\n\nstroke\n\nhigh blood pressure\n\nhigh cholesterol\n\ndiabetes\n\nhaving obesity\n\nHaving Down syndrome can also increase the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This is because the additional copy of chromosome 21 (which causes Down syndrome to occur) also contains the gene that creates amyloid.\n\nOlder adults who are Latino or African American may have an increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease compared with older adults who are white. Although the reason for this is not understood, it may be due to increased rates of vascular disease.\n\nLearn about dementia in the Black community here.\n\n### Vascular dementia\n\nTreatment for vascular dementia may help to manage symptoms and prevent the condition from worsening. It can include medications to help prevent strokes and further damage to the brain.\n\nMedications healthcare professionals prescribe to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease may help to treat early vascular dementia in some cases.\n\nTreatment includes managing any underlying health conditions that are risk factors for a stroke.\n\n### Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\nTreatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease may help to manage behavioral and cognitive symptoms, as well as treating the underlying process that causes the disease.\n\nTreatments may include:\n\nmedications such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, to help manage symptoms\n\nmedications such as aducanumab to help treat the underlying disease process\n\nnondrug and drug-based options to help manage symptoms such as agitation and difficulty sleeping\n\nmaking adjustments to manage behavioral symptoms, such as creating a calm environment and allowing sufficient time to rest\n\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease may help maintain how well a person can function for longer, as well as help people plan for the future.\n\nResearch and clinical trials for dementia treatments are ongoing. To find out more about clinical trials, speak with a healthcare professional.\n\n## Prevention\n\nEvidence suggests that there are steps people can take to reduce their risk of cognitive decline and dementia. These include:\n\ntaking part in regular physical exercise that elevates heart rate, as this increases blood flow to the brain and improves cardiovascular health\n\ncontinuing to learn through reading, taking a class at a local center, or taking an online course\n\nquitting smoking\n\ntaking steps to keep the heart healthy and reduce the risk of obesity, high blood pressure, and stroke\n\nprotecting the head from brain injury by:wearing a seatbeltusing a helmet for contact sports and cyclingtaking measures to help prevent falls\n\nwearing a seatbelt\n\nusing a helmet for contact sports and cycling\n\ntaking measures to help prevent falls\n\neating a nutritious, balanced diet full of vegetables and fruits\n\npracticing good sleep hygiene for quality sleep\n\nmanaging stress and any mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety\n\nconnecting socially with others\n\nchallenging the brain with puzzles, learning a new skill, or doing something creative\n\n## Summary\n\nBoth vascular dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease are types of dementia that can affect thinking, behavior, and the ability to carry out everyday tasks.\n\nVascular dementia occurs through damage to blood vessels in the brain. Alzheimer\u2019s disease occurs through plaques and tangles forming in the brain.\n\nMemory loss may be a major symptom of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It may also occur in vascular dementia, depending on which area of the brain the damage affects.\n\nTreatments for both conditions may help to manage symptoms and slow down cognitive decline. Managing risk factors may also help to prevent further damage to the brain.\n\nStroke\n\nAlzheimer's / Dementia",
            "# Vascular Dementia\n\nVascular dementia is a decline in thinking skills caused by conditions that block or reduce blood flow to various regions of the brain, depriving them of oxygen and nutrients.\n\nAbout\n\nSymptoms\n\nDiagnosis\n\nCauses and risks\n\nTreatment\n\n## About vascular dementia\n\nInadequate blood flow can damage and eventually kill cells anywhere in the body, but the brain is especially vulnerable.\n\r\nIn vascular dementia, changes in thinking skills sometimes occur suddenly after a stroke, which blocks major blood vessels in the brain. Thinking difficulties may also begin as mild changes that gradually worsen as a result of multiple minor strokes or another condition that affects smaller blood vessels, leading to widespread damage. A growing number of experts prefer the term \u201cvascular cognitive impairment\u201d (VCI) to \u201cvascular dementia\u201d because they feel it better expresses the concept that vascular thinking changes can range from mild to severe.\n\nVascular brain changes often coexist with changes linked to other types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Several studies have found that vascular changes and other brain abnormalities may interact in ways that increase the likelihood of dementia diagnosis. Sign up for our e-news to receive updates about Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia care and research.\n\n## Other dementias share some common symptoms\n\nVascular changes that start in brain areas that play a key role in storing and retrieving information may cause memory loss that looks very much like Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAbout 5% to 10% of people with dementia have vascular dementia alone. It is more common as a part of mixed dementia. Many experts believe that vascular dementia remains underdiagnosed \u2014 like Alzheimer's disease \u2014 even though it's recognized as common.\n\nLearn more: Key Types of Dementia, Mixed Dementia\n\n## Symptoms\n\nThe impact of vascular conditions on thinking skills varies widely, depending on the severity of the blood vessel damage and the part of the brain it affects. Memory loss may or may not be a significant symptom depending on the specific brain areas where blood flow is reduced. Vascular damage that starts in the brain areas that play a key role in storing and retrieving information may cause memory loss that is very similar to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\r\nSymptoms may be most obvious when they happen soon after a major stroke. Sudden post-stroke changes in thinking and perception may include:\n\nConfusion\n\nDisorientation\n\nTrouble speaking or understanding speech\n\nPhysical stroke symptoms, such as a\r\n\tsudden headache\n\nDifficulty walking\n\nPoor balance\n\nNumbness or paralysis on one side of the face or the body\n\nMultiple small strokes or other conditions that affect blood vessels and nerve fibers deep inside the brain may cause more gradual thinking changes as damage accumulates. Common early signs of widespread small vessel disease include impaired planning and judgment, uncontrolled laughing and crying, declining ability to pay attention, impaired function in social situations, and difficulty finding the right words.\n\nLearn more: Warning Signs from the American Stroke Association\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nDiagnostic guidelines for vascular dementia have used a range of definitions for dementia and various approaches to diagnosis. In 2011, the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association issued a joint scientific statement on vascular contributions to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association participated in developing the statement, which is also endorsed by the American Academy of Neurology. The goals of the statement, which include practice recommendations, are to raise awareness of the importance of vascular factors in cognitive change, increase diagnostic consistency and accelerate research.\n\r\nUnder the diagnostic approach recommended in the 2011 statement, the following criteria suggest the greatest likelihood of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia is caused by vascular changes:\n\nThe diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment is confirmed by neurocognitive testing, which involves several hours of written or computerized tests that provide detailed evaluation of specific thinking skills such as judgment, planning, problem-solving, reasoning and memory.\n\nThere is brain imaging evidence, usually with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), confirming:\r\n\t\nA recent stroke, or\nOther vascular brain changes whose severity and pattern of affected tissue are consistent with the types of impairment documented in cognitive testing.\n\nA recent stroke, or\n\nOther vascular brain changes whose severity and pattern of affected tissue are consistent with the types of impairment documented in cognitive testing.\n\nThere is no evidence that nonvascular factors may be contributing to cognitive decline.\n\nThe statement also details variations in these criteria that may suggest a possibility rather than a strong likelihood that cognitive change is due to vascular factors.\n\r\nBecause vascular dementia often goes unrecognized, many experts recommend professional cognitive screening for everyone considered to be at high risk, including those who have had a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also known as a ministroke, or who have risk factors for heart or blood vessel disease. Professional screening for depression is also recommended for high-risk groups. Depression commonly coexists with brain vascular disease and can contribute to cognitive impairment.\n\nLearn more: AHA/ASA Scientific Statement: Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment and Dementia, Mixed Dementia\n\n## Causes and risks\n\nAny condition that damages blood vessels anywhere in the body can cause brain changes linked to vascular dementia. As with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, advancing age is a major risk factor.\n\r\nAdditional risk factors for vascular dementia coincide with those that increase risk for heart disease, stroke and other conditions affecting blood vessels. Many of these factors are also linked to increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\r\nThe following strategies may reduce the risk of developing diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels \u2014 and may help protect the brain:\n\nDon't smoke.\n\nKeep your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar within recommended limits.\n\nEat a healthy, balanced diet.\n\nExercise.\n\nMaintain a healthy weight.\n\nLimit alcohol consumption.\n\nLearn more: Brain Health\n\n## Treatment and outcomes\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any drugs specifically to treat symptoms of vascular dementia, but there is evidence from clinical trials that drugs approved to treat Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms may also offer a modest benefit in people with vascular dementia. Treatment primarily works to prevent the worsening of vascular dementia by treating the underlying disease, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia or diabetes mellitus.\n\r\nControlling risk factors that may increase the likelihood of further damage to the brain\u2019s blood vessels is an important treatment strategy. There\u2019s substantial evidence that treatment of risk factors may improve outcomes and help postpone or prevent further decline.\n\r\nIndividuals should work with their physicians to develop the best treatment plan for their symptoms and circumstances.\n\nLike other types of dementia, vascular dementia shortens life span. Some data suggest that those who develop dementia following a stroke survive an average of three years. As with other stroke symptoms, cognitive changes may sometimes improve during recovery and rehabilitation from the acute phase of a stroke as the brain generates new blood vessels and brain cells outside the damaged region take on new roles.\n\nLearn more: Clinical Studies for Dementia"

            "# Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Fact Sheet\n\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\nMany people wonder if Alzheimer\u2019s disease runs in their family. Is it in your genes? This question isn\u2019t easy to answer. Researchers have identified several genetic variants that are associated with Alzheimer\u2019s and may increase or decrease a person\u2019s risk of developing the disease. What does that mean? Let\u2019s first learn about the role of genes.\n\n## Genes and Alzheimer's disease\n\nIn most cases, Alzheimer\u2019s does not have a single genetic cause. Instead, it can be influenced by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. Consequently, a person may carry more than one genetic variant or group of variants that can either increase or reduce the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nImportantly, people who develop Alzheimer\u2019s do not always have a history of the disease in their families. Still, those who have a parent or sibling diagnosed with the disease have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s than those without that association.\n\n### Genetic variants that affect Alzheimer's disease risk\n\nIn 2010, we knew of just 10 genetic areas associated with Alzheimer\u2019s. Today, thanks in large part to the work of NIH-funded researchers, we know of at least 80 genetic areas associated with this disease. Understanding which genes play a role \u2014 and what role they play \u2014 may help identify new methods to prevent, delay, or treat dementia.\n\nOne well-known gene that influences Alzheimer\u2019s risk is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. The APOE gene is involved in making a protein that helps carry cholesterol and other types of fat in the bloodstream. Problems in this process are thought to contribute to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s. APOE comes in several forms, called alleles (e.g., \u03b52, \u03b53).\n\nAPOE \u03b52 may provide some protection against the disease. If Alzheimer\u2019s occurs in a person with this allele, it usually develops later in life than it would in someone with the APOE \u03b54 gene. Roughly 5% to 10% of people have this allele.\n\nAPOE \u03b53, the most common allele, is believed to have a neutral effect on the disease \u2014 neither decreasing nor increasing risk of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nAPOE \u03b54 increases risk for Alzheimer\u2019s and is associated with an earlier age of disease onset in certain populations. About 15% to 25% of people have this allele, and 2% to 5% carry two copies.\n\nEach person inherits two APOE alleles, one from each biological parent, meaning people can have one of six possible combinations: 2/2, 2/3, 2/4, 3/3, 3/4, and 4/4. Having two copies of APOE \u03b54 is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer\u2019s than having one copy. While inheriting APOE \u03b54 increases a person\u2019s risk of Alzheimer\u2019s, some people with an APOE \u03b54 allele never develop the disease.\n\nResearchers are also finding other rare genetic variants, in addition to APOE \u03b52, that appear to provide some protection against developing Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nHowever, prevalence and risk associated with APOE and other genetic variants may not be the same across all population groups. Research suggests that the degree of risk may be affected by genetic ancestry \u2014 the global geographic region from which a person is biologically descended \u2014 and differ among people of African, Asian, American Indian, and European descent. More research is needed to better understand how certain genetic variants might affect a person\u2019s or group\u2019s risk for Alzheimer\u2019s and to identify treatment and prevention strategies that will work best for that particular group.",

Still, those who have a parent or sibling diagnosed with the disease have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s than those without that association.\n\n### Genetic variants that cause Alzheimer's disease\n\nOf the genetic variants so far associated with Alzheimer\u2019s, three rare single-gene variants are known to cause the disease:\n\nAmyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21\n\nPresenilin 1 (PSEN1) on chromosome 14\n\nPresenilin 2 (PSEN2) on chromosome 1\n\nA child whose biological parent carries a genetic variant for one of these three genes has a 50/50 chance of inheriting that altered version of the gene. If the variant is inherited, the child has a very strong probability of developing Alzheimer\u2019s before age 65 and sometimes much earlier. When someone develops Alzheimer\u2019s before age 65, it\u2019s known as \u201cearly-onset Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d or sometimes \u201cyounger-onset Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d or \u201cearlier-onset Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d Less than 10% of all people with Alzheimer\u2019s develop symptoms this early. Of those who do, 10% to 15% can be attributed to changes in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2.\n\nChanges in these three genes result in the production of abnormal proteins that are associated with the disease. Each of these mutations contributes to the breakdown of APP, a protein that\u2019s function isn\u2019t completely understood. The breakdown of APP is part of a process that makes harmful forms of sticky amyloid fragments. These fragments cluster to form plaques in the brain, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIn addition to the three genetic variants that are known to cause Alzheimer\u2019s, people with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21, which carries the APP gene, and a higher risk of developing early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s. Estimates suggest that 50% or more of people living with Down syndrome will develop Alzheimer\u2019s with symptoms appearing in their 50s and 60s.

            "# Combination of healthy lifestyle traits may substantially reduce Alzheimer\u2019s\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\n# Combination of healthy lifestyle traits may substantially reduce Alzheimer\u2019s\n\nCombining more healthy lifestyle behaviors was associated with substantially lower risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease in a study that included data from nearly 3,000 research participants. Those who adhered to four or all of the five specified healthy behaviors were found to have a 60% lower risk of Alzheimer\u2019s. The behaviors were physical activity, not smoking, light-to-moderate alcohol consumption, a high-quality diet, and cognitive activities. Funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), part of the National Institutes of Health, this research was published in the June 17, 2020, online issue of Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n\u201cThis observational study provides more evidence on how a combination of modifiable behaviors may mitigate Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk,\u201d said NIA Director Richard J. Hodes, M.D. \u201cThe findings strengthen the association between healthy behaviors and lower risk, and add to the basis for controlled clinical trials to directly test the ability of interventions to slow or prevent development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d\n\nThe research team reviewed data from two NIA-funded longitudinal study populations: The Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) and the Memory and Aging Project (MAP). They selected participants from those studies who had data available on their diet, lifestyle factors, genetics, and clinical assessments for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The resulting data pool included 1,845 participants from CHAP and 920 from MAP.\n\nThe researchers scored each participant based on five healthy lifestyle factors, all of which have important health benefits:\n\nAt least 150 minutes per week of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity \u2013 Physical activity is an important part of healthy aging.\n\nNot smoking \u2013 Established research has confirmed that even in people 60 or older who have been smoking for decades, quitting will improve health.\n\nLight-to-moderate alcohol consumption \u2013 Limiting use of alcohol may help cognitive health.\n\nA high-quality, Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, which combines the Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet \u2013 The MIND diet focuses on plant-based foods linked to dementia prevention.\n\nEngagement in late-life cognitive activities \u2013 Being intellectually engaged by keeping the mind active may benefit the brain.\n\nThe research team then compared the scores with outcomes of clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s in the CHAP and MAP participants. Lead author of the paper, Klodian Dhana, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor at Rush University Medical Center, emphasized that the combination of healthy lifestyle factors is key. He wrote that compared to participants with no or one healthy lifestyle factors, the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s was 37% lower in those with two to three, and 60% lower in those with four to five healthy lifestyle factors.\n\n\u201cThis population-based study helps paint the picture of how multiple factors are likely playing parts in Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk,\u201d said Dallas Anderson, Ph.D., program director in the Division of Neuroscience at NIA. \u201cIt\u2019s not a clear cause and effect result, but a strong finding because of the dual data sets and combination of modifiable lifestyle factors that appear to lead to risk reduction.\u201d\n\nA 2017 research review and report commissioned by NIA concluded that evidence on lifestyle factors such as increasing physical activity, along with blood pressure management and cognitive training, is \u201cencouraging although inconclusive\u201d for preventing Alzheimer\u2019s. Since then, more research has emerged, such as the SPRINT MIND trial, which suggests intensive blood pressure control may slow age-related brain damage, and new trials have launched. For example:\n\nThe NIA-funded MIND Diet Intervention to Prevent Alzheimer's Disease is an interventional clinical trial comparing parallel groups with two different diets. An NIA-funded collaboration between Rush University and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Brigham & Women's Hospital (grant number R01AG052583). MIND has enrolled more than 600 participants and is ongoing with an anticipated completion date in 2021.\n\nThe U.S. Study to Protect Brain Health Through Lifestyle Intervention to Reduce Risk (U.S. POINTER) is a multisite randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate whether lifestyle interventions \u2014 including the MIND diet \u2014 may protect cognitive function in older adults who are at increased risk for cognitive decline. NIA is funding the imaging, neurovascular, and sleep ancillary studies of POINTER.\n\nNIA is currently funding more than 230 active clinical trials on Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias. Of those, more than 100 are nondrug interventions, such as exercise, diet, cognitive training, sleep, or combination therapies. People interested in participating in clinical trials can find more information on the NIA website.\n\nThe research in this study is funded by NIH grants R01AG054476, R01AG052583, P30AG10161, R01AG17917, R01AG11101, R01AG051635, RF1AG057532, and R01AG058679.\n\nAbout the National Institute on Aging (NIA): NIA leads the U.S. federal government effort to conduct and support research on aging and the health and well-being of older people.

            "## 1. Overview\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by the decline in cognitive and function and neuronal loss. AD currently affects over 5 million Americans [1] and is expected to become increasingly prevalent with the rise in life expectancy. It is estimated that by 2050, 13.8 million Americans will be living with AD [2]. The financial burden imposed by AD currently exceeds $230 billion and is expected to reach $1.1 trillion by 2050 [3]. Given the clinical and financial burden associated with AD, the identification of novel mechanisms responsible for pathogenesis, as well as novel therapeutic targets, is urgently needed.\n\nAD is characterized by two core pathologies, the presence of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). A\u03b2 pathology arises from the improper cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) resulting in A\u03b2 monomers that aggregate forming oligomeric A\u03b2 and eventually aggregating into A\u03b2 fibrils and plaques [4]. The function of APP is unknown but is believed to have a role in cell health and growth [5]. Critical aspects of understanding the onset of A\u03b2 pathology rests on knowing the mechanisms of the generation of A\u03b2 monomers, their clearance, and their aggregation into oligomeric A\u03b2. Normal\u00a0processing of the APP sequence consists of nonamyloidogenic proteolysis of APP via \u03b1-secretase and \u03bb-secretase, producing soluble fragments [6]. When APP is cleaved by \u03bb-secretase and erroneous \u03b2-secretase, it leads to insoluble amyloid \u03b2 peptides that aggregate in the brain to form \u03b2-amyloid plaques [4], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The precise role of A\u03b2 in AD pathology remains an open question as A\u03b2 plaques may accumulate up to 10\u00a0years before any observable AD symptoms or diagnosis.\n\nThe second core pathology, NFT, arises from the hyperphosphorylation of tau, a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Phosphorylation of tau serves a necessary role in intracellular trafficking to remove tau from microtubules, allowing transport, followed by dephosphorylation to return tau to the microtubule [28]. In AD, tau protein is phosphorylated at multiple sites resulting in the removal of tau from the microtubule and causing the collapse of microtubule structures and disruption in a number of cellular processes ranging from protein trafficking to overall cellular morphology [29], [30], [31]. In addition, the hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) aggregates into paired helical fragments that eventually form neurofibrillary tangles [20], [24], [25], [32], [33]. The accumulation of ptau tangles and the compromised cellular function leads to loss of neuronal function, and ultimately apoptosis\u00a0[30].\n\nDespite extensive and productive research investigating the mechanisms responsible for both core pathologies, as well as approaches aimed at the prevention of A\u03b2 plaques and NFT, there remains no treatment that effectively alters either pathology in clinical populations [34]. Furthermore, there exists a considerable gap in the understanding of AD pathogenesis given these two pathological features. As stated previously, patients may exhibit A\u03b2 plaque pathology for up to or greater than a decade before any overt diagnosis of AD [35], [36]. For NFT, the overall tangle load is correlated with cognitive decline in AD; however, the appearance of NFT appears to occur before the inauguration of AD pathology in clinical populations and preclinical animal models [37], [38], [39]. The combination of the aforementioned gaps in the pathophysiology of AD suggests that other pathological mechanisms may be driving both the onset of the disorder, as well as the progression of the disease.\n\nOver the last 10\u00a0years, a third core feature of AD has emerged that may provide insight into AD pathogenesis, as well as provide a link between the other two core pathologies. A number of investigations initially demonstrated that in addition to A\u03b2 plaques and NFT, the brains of patients with AD exhibited evidence of a sustained inflammatory response [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50]. The inflammatory response has now been observed in multiple studies of postmortem tissues of AD patient samples [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57] and is routinely observed in preclinical model systems of AD.\n\nAcute inflammation in the brain is a well-established defense against infection, toxins, and injury, but when a disruption in the equilibrium of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory signaling occurs, as seen in AD, it results in chronic inflammation (neuroinflammation) [58], [59], [60], [61]. This chronic neuroinflammation is attributed to activated microglia cells and the release of numerous cytokines. The presence of a sustained immune response in the brain is not exclusive to AD. A number of studies have demonstrated elevated markers of inflammation in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], and traumatic brain injury associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) [67], [68], [69], [70], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [70], and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) [71] to name a few key examples. It is increasingly recognized that a sustained immune response is a central feature of neurodegenerative disorders [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77].\n\nThe presence of a sustained inflammatory response in the brain of patients with AD was, at one point, thought to be reactive to the neuronal loss occurring in the disorder. However, substantial body of research has now demonstrated that a persistent immune response in the brain is not only associated with neurodegeneration but it also facilitates and exacerbates both A\u03b2 and NFT pathologies. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the inflammatory response may provide a link between the initial A\u03b2 pathology and the later development of NFT [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83]. In the succeeding sections, we highlight some of the recent data indicating the role of inflammation in AD, as well as data indicating inflammation may be a central mechanism driving A\u03b2 pathology and progression.\n\nThis review highlights the research supported by the National Institutes of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) through Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) awards that develop the national research infrastructure.",
            "## 2. Inflammation in AD\n\nMany studies now point to the involvement of neuroinflammation playing a fundamental role in the progression of the neuropathological changes that are observed in AD. Since the 1980s, there have been reports of immune-related proteins and cells located within close proximity to \u03b2-amyloid plaques [43], [84]. Beginning in the 1990s, several large epidemiological and observational studies were published indicating that anti-inflammatory treatments used in diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, showed protective qualities against developing AD, demonstrating as much as a 50% reduction in the risk for developing AD in patients who are long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) users [77], [85], [86], [87]. These studies lead to studies utilizing animal transgenic AD models demonstrating that NSAIDs can reduce AD pathology [88]. Human trials of NSAIDS showed variable outcomes with no convincing evidence of benefit using the trial methods of the time [89].\n\nThese various epidemiological studies and observational studies serve as the bedrock of support for neuroinflammation playing a major role in developing sAD. Unlike other risk factors and genetic causes of AD, neuroinflammation is not typically thought to be causal on its own but rather a result of one or more of the other AD pathologies or risk factors associated with AD and serves to increase the severity of the disease by exacerbating \u03b2-amyloid and tau pathologies [90], [91].\n\nBrain inflammation appears to have a dual function, playing a neuroprotective role during an acute-phase response, but becomes detrimental when a chronic response is mounted [92]. Chronically activated microglia release a variety of proinflammatory and toxic products, including reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and cytokines. In deceased patients suffering from recent head trauma, there is an increase in cerebral A\u03b2 deposits 1\u20133\u00a0weeks postinjury, and it has been shown that elevated levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1) are responsible for the increased APP production and A\u03b2 load [93], [94]. In addition, elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2 has been shown to increase the production of other cytokines, including IL-6, which in turn has been shown to stimulate the activation of CDK5, a kinase known to hyperphosphorylate tau [95]. The neuroinflammation observed in AD appears to serve a primary role in exacerbating A\u03b2 burden and tau hyperphosphorylation, suggesting that this dual role could be a leading link between these seemingly disparate core AD pathologies. The mounted immune response via the brain's resident macrophage (microglia) is now a central tenant in the investigation of AD.\n\n### 2.1. Microglia\n\nMicroglia are the resident immune cells within the central nervous system (CNS) [96]. In a healthy brain, microglia are in an inactive, \u201cresting\u201d state and are described morphologically as ramified cells with small somas [97], [98]. In this state, the cell somas are stationary, while the cell processes extend and retract, surveying their environment and communicating with neurons and other glia cells [99], [100], [101]. Overall surveillance of the surrounding neuronal environment is accomplished via a large number of signaling mechanisms [99], [102]. This includes surveillance of the local neuronal milieu via numerous receptors for classical neurotransmitters [103], receptors for numerous cytokines and chemokines [104], [105], [106], and a number of receptors, such as fractalkine (CX3CR1), that bind ligands constitutively released in healthy neuronal environments [107]. When microglia recognize a threat to the CNS, such as invasion, injury, or disease, it leads to microglial activation, causing a morphological change resulting in retraction of processes, enlargement of the cell, and migration [99], [108], [109], [110], [111]. Transitioning into an activated state may be triggered by alterations in any number of the aforementioned mechanisms involved in surveillance.\n\nIn AD, it is hypothesized that the primary driver of activation of microglia is the presence of A\u03b2. Activated microglia respond to A\u03b2 resulting in migration to the plaques and phagocytosis of A\u03b2 [108], [112], [113]. A number of investigations have demonstrated that activated microglia phagocytose A\u03b2 [114], [115], [116], [117]; however, these microglia become enlarged and after prolonged periods are no longer able to process A\u03b2 [114], [118]. Early in AD pathogenesis, the mounted immune response results in clearance of A\u03b2 and has been demonstrated to exert positive effects on AD-related pathologies in animal models' systems [77], [119], [120]. However, prolonged activation of the immune response has been demonstrated to result in an exacerbation of AD pathology, likely as a result of sustained activation of microglia in a feed forward loop, referred to as reactive microgliosis. This results in an accumulation of A\u03b2 and sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine singling beginning to damage neurons [118], [121], [122]. The sustained activation also results in a decrease in microglia efficiency for binding and phagocytosing A\u03b2 and decreases in A\u03b2 degrading enzyme activity of microglia leading, in turn, to a reduced ability to break down the A\u03b2 plaques [123], [124]. However, data indicate that the microglial capacity for producing pro-inflammatory cytokines is unaffected [118]. These data demonstrate a unique feature of pathogenesis in that overall clearance of A\u03b2 becomes compromised while immune activation continues simultaneously. The continued release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and associated neurotoxins from microglia serves to exacerbate the neuroinflammation and contribute to neurodegeneration, leading to the activation of yet more microglia.\n\nAs the microglia are involved in clearance of A\u03b2, they release a number of proinflammatory cytokines that recruit additional microglia to plaques [125], [126], [127], resulting in a characteristic halo of activated microglia surrounding plaques [112], [128]. More recent data indicate that as microglia become less able to clear A\u03b2, peripheral macrophages may be recruited to A\u03b2 plaque deposition in an effort to clear A\u03b2 [129]. The recruitment of peripheral macrophages into the brain likely exacerbates the effects of sustained inflammation and thus AD pathology. Some of the most compelling data for the importance of inflammation in AD pathogenesis and the regulation of the immune response comes from the recent demonstration that a mutation in the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) confers a greater likelihood of developing AD [129], [130], [131], [132]. A rare missense mutation in\u00a0TREM2 results in a substantial elevated risk of AD [133], [134], [135], [136]."

            "# Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Fact Sheet\n\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\nMany people wonder if Alzheimer\u2019s disease runs in their family. Is it in your genes? This question isn\u2019t easy to answer. Researchers have identified several genetic variants that are associated with Alzheimer\u2019s and may increase or decrease a person\u2019s risk of developing the disease. What does that mean? Let\u2019s first learn about the role of genes.\n\n## Genes and Alzheimer's disease\n\nIn most cases, Alzheimer\u2019s does not have a single genetic cause. Instead, it can be influenced by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. Consequently, a person may carry more than one genetic variant or group of variants that can either increase or reduce the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nImportantly, people who develop Alzheimer\u2019s do not always have a history of the disease in their families. Still, those who have a parent or sibling diagnosed with the disease have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s than those without that association.\n\n### Genetic variants that affect Alzheimer's disease risk\n\nIn 2010, we knew of just 10 genetic areas associated with Alzheimer\u2019s. Today, thanks in large part to the work of NIH-funded researchers, we know of at least 80 genetic areas associated with this disease. Understanding which genes play a role \u2014 and what role they play \u2014 may help identify new methods to prevent, delay, or treat dementia.\n\nOne well-known gene that influences Alzheimer\u2019s risk is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. The APOE gene is involved in making a protein that helps carry cholesterol and other types of fat in the bloodstream. Problems in this process are thought to contribute to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s. APOE comes in several forms, called alleles (e.g., \u03b52, \u03b53).\n\nAPOE \u03b52 may provide some protection against the disease. If Alzheimer\u2019s occurs in a person with this allele, it usually develops later in life than it would in someone with the APOE \u03b54 gene. Roughly 5% to 10% of people have this allele.\n\nAPOE \u03b53, the most common allele, is believed to have a neutral effect on the disease \u2014 neither decreasing nor increasing risk of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nAPOE \u03b54 increases risk for Alzheimer\u2019s and is associated with an earlier age of disease onset in certain populations. About 15% to 25% of people have this allele, and 2% to 5% carry two copies.\n\nEach person inherits two APOE alleles, one from each biological parent, meaning people can have one of six possible combinations: 2/2, 2/3, 2/4, 3/3, 3/4, and 4/4. Having two copies of APOE \u03b54 is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer\u2019s than having one copy. While inheriting APOE \u03b54 increases a person\u2019s risk of Alzheimer\u2019s, some people with an APOE \u03b54 allele never develop the disease.\n\nResearchers are also finding other rare genetic variants, in addition to APOE \u03b52, that appear to provide some protection against developing Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nHowever, prevalence and risk associated with APOE and other genetic variants may not be the same across all population groups. Research suggests that the degree of risk may be affected by genetic ancestry \u2014 the global geographic region from which a person is biologically descended \u2014 and differ among people of African, Asian, American Indian, and European descent. More research is needed to better understand how certain genetic variants might affect a person\u2019s or group\u2019s risk for Alzheimer\u2019s and to identify treatment and prevention strategies that will work best for that particular group."

            "# Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) results from an impact to the head that disrupts normal brain function. TBI may affect a person's cognitive abilities, including learning and thinking skills.\n\nAbout\n\nCauses and risk factors\n\nPreventing traumatic brain injury\n\nSymptoms\n\nDiagnosis\n\nTreatment\n\nResearch\n\n## About traumatic brain injury\n\nMost TBIs are caused by falls, being struck by an object or by vehicle crashes. Doctors may classify traumatic brain injury as mild, moderate or severe, depending on whether the injury causes unconsciousness, how long unconsciousness lasts and the severity of the individual's symptoms. Although most TBIs are classified as mild because they're not life-threatening, a mild TBI can have serious and long-lasting effects; the extent of these effects is not fully understood and requires more research.\n\r\nSome of these injuries are considered primary \u2014 damage and symptoms are immediate. Other outcomes of TBI can be secondary \u2014 they can occur gradually over hours or days, or appear weeks later. These secondary brain injuries are the result of reactive processes that occur after the initial head trauma.\n\r\nTBI resulting from an impact to the head disrupts normal brain function and is a threat to cognitive health in two ways:\n\nA traumatic brain injury's direct effects \u2014 which may be long-lasting or even permanent \u2014 can include unconsciousness, inability to recall the traumatic event, depression, confusion, difficulty learning and remembering new information, trouble speaking coherently, unsteadiness, lack of coordination and problems with vision or hearing.\n\nCertain types of TBI may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's or another type of dementia years after the injury takes place.\n\n## If a head injury occurs\n\nTBI can affect your brain even if you don't lose consciousness and your symptoms clear up quickly. Anyone who experiences an impact to the head and develops any symptoms of TBI should seek medical attention, even if symptoms seem mild. Call emergency services for anyone who:\n\nIs unconscious for more than a minute or two. Experiences seizures, repeated vomiting or symptoms that seem to worsen as time passes.\n\nWas ejected from a vehicle and sustained a head injury.\n\nWas struck by a vehicle while on foot.\n\nHas fallen from a height of more than three feet.\n\n## Causes and risk factors\n\nThe leading causes of TBI that result in emergency department visits are falls, being struck by an object and motor vehicle crashes. Indirect forces that shake the brain violently within the skull, such as shock waves from battlefield explosions, can also cause TBI. In addition, TBI can result from bullet wounds or other injuries that penetrate the skull and brain. However, it is important to note that not all blows or jolts to the head result in a TBI.\u00a0\n\r\nFalls are the most common cause of TBI, and falling poses an especially serious risk for older adults. According to the CDC, approximately 1 in 4 Americans ages 65 and over reports falling each year. Falls lead to 3 million emergency department visits per year. The number of deaths from falls is rising. Between 2007 and 2016, the number of deaths among older Americans rose 62%, to 29,668. Those ages 75 and older are three times as likely as those between 65 and 74 to be hospitalized from a fall. Men are twice as likely to be hospitalized as women.\n\r\nWhen a person over 65 years old sustains a serious TBI in a fall, direct effects of the injury may result in long-term cognitive changes, reduced ability to function and changes in emotional health. Older adults who experienced loss of consciousness after a TBI were 28% more likely to report subjective memory impairment than seniors who did not experience a TBI.\n\n## Symptoms\n\nThe severity of symptoms depends on whether the injury is mild, moderate or severe. In all forms of TBI, cognitive changes (changes in how people think) are among the most common, most disabling and longest-lasting symptoms that can result from the injury. The ability to learn and remember new information is often affected. Other commonly affected cognitive skills include the capacity to pay attention, organize thoughts, plan effective strategies for completing tasks and activities and make good judgments. More severe changes in thinking skills \u2014 a hallmark characteristic of dementia \u2014 may develop years after the injury took place and the person appears to have recovered from its immediate effects.\n\n### Symptoms of mild TBI\n\nMild TBI, also known as a concussion, does not necessarily cause loss of consciousness or causes unconsciousness that lasts for 30 minutes or less. Mild TBI symptoms may include:\n\nInability to remember the cause of the injury or events that occurred immediately before or up to 24 hours after it happened.\n\nConfusion and disorientation.\n\nDifficulty remembering new information.\n\nProblems with finding words.\n\nHeadache.\n\nDizziness.\n\nBlurry vision.\n\nSensitivity to light and/or sound.\n\nChange in energy or motivation.\n\nNausea and vomiting.\n\nRinging in the ears.\n\nTrouble speaking clearly.\n\nChanges in emotions or sleep patterns.\n\nThese symptoms usually appear at the time of the injury or soon after, but sometimes may not develop for days or weeks. Mild TBI symptoms are usually temporary and clear up within hours, days or weeks; however, on occasion, they can last months or longer.\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nEvaluations by health care professionals typically include:\n\nQuestions about how the injury happened.\n\nAssessment of the person's level of consciousness and confusion.\n\nAn examination to assess memory and thinking, vision, hearing, touch, balance, gait, coordination, strength and sensation, reflexes and other indicators of brain function.\n\nLet your physician know if you are taking medications (prescription, over-the-counter or natural remedies), especially blood thinners such as Coumadin and aspirin, because they can increase the chance of complications. Also inform your health care professional if you drink alcohol or take drugs.\n\r\nDepending on the cause of the TBI and the severity of symptoms, brain imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (RN) may be needed to determine if there's bleeding or swelling in the brain. If you experience a TBI, it should be noted in your permanent medical record and mentioned whenever giving a new doctor your medical history.\n\n## Does every hit to the head lead to dementia?\n\nThere's no evidence that a single mild TBI increases cognitive decline and dementia risk. Although currently, there's no known strategy to reduce the possible long-term risk of cognitive decline and dementia once you've experienced a moderate or severe TBI or repeated mild traumatic brain injuries, it's important to understand that not everyone who experiences a head injury in one of these categories develops dementia. Ongoing research is aimed at understanding the underlying mechanisms of the connection between TBI, cognitive decline and dementia in the brain, including the role of potential exacerbating factors.\n\n## Treatment\n\nThe most serious traumatic brain injuries require specialized hospital care and can require months of inpatient rehabilitation. Most traumatic brain injuries are mild, however, and can be managed with either an ER visit, a short hospital stay for observation or at-home monitoring followed by outpatient rehabilitation, if needed.\n\r\nTreatment of dementia in a person with a history of traumatic brain injuries varies depending on the type of dementia diagnosed. Strategies for treating Alzheimer's or another specific type of dementia are the same for individuals with and without a history of TBI.\n\r\nHowever, the contributions of TBI to cognition is a relatively new area of exploration for researchers and physicians, formal clinical guidelines for diagnosing and managing this condition do not yet exist. Several major research initiatives are under way to gain further insights into the patterns of injury and brain changes implicated in the context of TBI, and to develop new strategies for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.\n\r\nLearn more: Treatment for Dementia, Treatment for Alzheimer's\n\n## Research on cognitive decline, dementia and traumatic brain injury\n\nOver the past 30 years, research has linked moderate and severe TBI to a greater risk of cognitive decline or dementia years after the original head injury. The key studies showing an increased risk found that older adults with a history of moderate TBI had a 2.3 times greater risk of developing Alzheimer's than seniors with no history of head injury. Those with a history of severe TBI had a 4.5 times greater risk. Other studies \u2014 but not all \u2014 have found a link between moderate and severe TBI and higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia.\n\nThere's no evidence that a single mild TBI increases dementia risk. However, emerging evidence does suggest that repeated mild traumatic brain injuries, such as those that can occur in sports like American football, boxing, hockey and soccer, may be linked to a greater risk of traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) or specific brain changes associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).\n\nThe symptoms of TES/CTE may include memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, impulse control problems, aggression, depression, anxiety, suicidality, parkinsonism (movement symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease) and, eventually, progressive dementia. These symptoms may begin years or even decades after the last traumatic brain injury.\n\nPrevious research has shown that boxers have an increased risk of specific brain changes associated with CTE and may be associated with changes in cognition. When an individual had these memory changes in the context of boxing-related injury, this was originally called dementia pugilistica or \"punch-drunk syndrome.\" The risk of the specific brain changes associated with CTE in boxers seems most closely tied to the number of rounds boxed, not to the number of times a boxer was knocked out, suggesting that even repeated mild traumatic brain injuries that don't cause unconsciousness may increase dementia risk. Brain changes associated with CTE can occur following a small number of severe traumatic brain injuries, or a large number of mild or very mild traumatic brain injuries, or some other pattern of head trauma.\n\nIn a study published in the March 23, 2016, online edition of the Journal of Neurology, Wei Li and colleagues found that a history of TBI may accelerate the age of onset of cognitive impairment by two or more years. These results were consistent with other studies that indicate TBI is a significant risk factor for cognitive decline in older adults and associated with an earlier age of onset in people with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAnother study conducted by researchers at Ume\u00e5 University in Sweden also found that TBI is a risk factor for dementia and revealed that the risk of a dementia diagnosis was highest during the first year after the injury. During this time, people who had a TBI were four to six times as likely to get a dementia diagnosis as those without a TBI. The study also concluded that a concussion or other TBI can increase the risk of developing dementia even 30 years later.\n\nA study published in 2021 in GeroScience demonstrated that brain changes in people with mild TBI and Alzheimer's had similarities. The researchers found that there was a reduction in cortical thickness in both Alzheimer's and TBI individuals when compared to healthy individuals. Cortical thinning is often associated with reduction in memory, verbal fluency and integrating new information and with decreased ability to make decisions\n\nMore research is needed to fully understand the relationship between TBI and dementia and to understand why moderate, severe and repeated mild traumatic brain injuries are at an increased risk with changes in memory, thinking and reasoning in individuals in later life.\n\nTraumatic brain injury may be more likely to increase the risk of dementia in individuals who have a specific variant of the gene for apolipoprotein E (APOE) called APOE-e4. More research is needed to understand the strength of the link between APOE-e4 and dementia risk in those who've had a TBI."

            "# 10 Early Signs and Symptoms of Alzheimer's and Dementia\n\nMemory loss that disrupts daily life may be a symptom of Alzheimer's or other dementia. Alzheimer's is a brain disease that causes a slow decline in memory, thinking and reasoning skills. There are 10 warning signs and symptoms. If you notice any of them, don't ignore them. Schedule an appointment with your doctor.\n\n## Memory loss that disrupts daily life\n\nOne of the most common signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, especially in the early stage, is forgetting recently learned information. Others include forgetting important dates or events, asking the same questions over and over, and increasingly needing to rely on memory aids (e.g., reminder notes or electronic devices) or family members for things they used to handle on their own.\n\nWhat's a typical age-related change?\r\nSometimes forgetting names or appointments, but remembering them later.\n\n## Challenges in planning or solving problems\n\nSome people living with changes in their memory due to Alzheimer's or other dementia may experience changes in their ability to develop and follow a plan or work with numbers. They may have trouble following a familiar recipe or keeping track of monthly bills. They may have difficulty concentrating and take much longer to do things than they did before.\n\nWhat's a typical age-related change? \r\nMaking occasional errors when managing finances or household bills.\n\n## Difficulty completing familiar tasks\n\nPeople living with memory changes from Alzheimer's or other dementia often find it hard to complete daily tasks. Sometimes they may have trouble driving to a familiar location, organizing a grocery list or remembering the rules of a favorite game.\n\nWhat's a typical age-related change? \r\nOccasionally needing help to use microwave settings or to record a TV show.\n\n## Confusion with time or place\n\nPeople living with Alzheimer's or other dementia can lose track of dates, seasons and the passage of time. They may have trouble understanding something if it is not happening immediately. Sometimes they may forget where they are or how they got there.\n\nWhat's a typical age-related change? \r\nGetting confused about the day of the week but figuring it out later.\n\n## Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships\n\nSome people living with Alzheimer's or other dementia could experience vision changes. This may lead to difficulty with balance or trouble reading. They may also have problems judging distance and determining color or contrast, causing issues with driving.\n\nWhat's a typical age-related change? \r\nVision changes related to cataracts.\n\n## New problems with words in speaking or writing\n\nPeople living with Alzheimer's or other dementia may have trouble following or joining a conversation. They may stop in the middle of a conversation and have no idea how to continue or they may repeat themselves. They may struggle with vocabulary, have trouble naming a familiar object or use the wrong name (e.g., calling a \"watch\" a \"hand-clock\").\n\nWhat's a typical age-related change? \r\nSometimes having trouble finding the right word.\n\n## Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps\n\nA person living with Alzheimer's or other dementia may put things in unusual places. They may lose things and be unable to go back over their steps to find them again. He or she may accuse others of stealing, especially as the disease progresses.\n\nWhat's a typical age-related change? \r\nMisplacing things from time to time and retracing steps to find them.\n\n## Decreased or poor judgment\n\nIndividuals living with Alzheimer's or other dementia may experience changes in judgment or decision-making. For example, they may use poor judgment when dealing with money or pay less attention to grooming or keeping themselves clean.\n\nWhat's a typical age-related change?\r\nMaking a bad decision or mistake once in a while, like neglecting to change the oil in the car.\n\n## Withdrawal from work or social activities\n\nA person living with Alzheimer\u2019s or other dementia may experience changes in the ability to hold or follow a conversation. As a result, they may withdraw from hobbies, social activities or other engagements. They may have trouble keeping up with a favorite team or activity.\n\nWhat's a typical age-related change? \r\nSometimes feeling uninterested in family or social obligations.\n\n## Changes in mood and personality\n\nIndividuals living with Alzheimer\u2019s or other dementia may experience mood and personality changes. They can become confused, suspicious, depressed, fearful or anxious. They may be easily upset at home, with friends or when out of their comfort zone.\n\nWhat's a typical age-related change? \r\nDeveloping very specific ways of doing things and becoming irritable when a routine is disrupted."

As a result, some people notice that they don\u2019t remember information as well as they once did and aren\u2019t able to recall it as quickly.

These usually are signs of mild forgetfulness, not a serious memory problem.\n\nIt\u2019s normal to forget things once in a while at any age, but serious memory problems make it hard to do everyday things such as driving, using the phone, and finding the way home.\n\nSigns that it might be time to talk with a doctor include:\n\nAsking the same questions over and over again\n\nGetting lost in places you used to know well\n\nHaving trouble following recipes or directions\n\nBecoming more confused about time, people, and places\n\nNot taking care of yourself \u2014 eating poorly, not bathing, or behaving unsafely\n\nTalk with a doctor if you are experiencing noticeable changes in your memory. A doctor can perform tests and assessments to help determine the source of memory problems. Your health care provider may also recommend that you see a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the brain and nervous system.\n\nYou may also wish to talk with your doctor about opportunities to participate in research on cognitive health and aging.\n\nTips for dealing with forgetfulness\n\nThere are a variety of techniques that may help you stay healthy and deal better with changes in memory and mental skills. Here are some tips:Learn a new skill.Follow a daily routine.Plan tasks, make to-do lists, and use memory tools such as calendars and notes.Put your wallet or purse, keys, phone, and glasses in the same place each day.Stay involved in activities that can help both the mind and body.Volunteer in your community, at a school, or at your place of worship.Spend time with friends and family.Get enough sleep, generally seven to eight hours each night.Exercise and eat well.Prevent or control high blood pressure.Avoid or limit alcohol.Get help if you feel depressed for weeks at a time.\n\n### Tips for dealing with forgetfulness\n\nThere are a variety of techniques that may help you stay healthy and deal better with changes in memory and mental skills.

People with MCI can usually take care of themselves and are able to carry out their day-to-day tasks. MCI may be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease, but not everyone with MCI will develop Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing changes in your memory or think you may have MCI, talk with your doctor. Learn more about the symptoms of MCI.\n\n## Dementia versus age-related forgetfulness\n\nForgetfulness can be a normal part of aging. However, dementia is not a normal part of aging. Dementia includes the loss of cognitive functioning \u2014 thinking, remembering, learning, and reasoning \u2014 and behavioral abilities to the extent that it interferes with a person\u2019s quality of life and activities. Memory loss, though common, is not the only sign of dementia. People with dementia may also have problems with language skills, visual perception, or paying attention. Some people experience personality changes.\n\nThere are different types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and vascular dementia, and symptoms may vary from person to person. The chart below compares some differences between normal aging and the signs of dementia.\n\nDifferences Between Normal Aging and DementiaNormal AgingDementiaMaking a bad decision once in a whileMaking poor judgments and decisions a lot of the timeMissing a monthly paymentProblems taking care of monthly billsForgetting which day it is and remembering it laterLosing track of the date or time of yearSometimes forgetting which word to useTrouble having a conversationLosing things from time to timeMisplacing things often and being unable to find them\n\n## What else can affect memory?\n\nIt\u2019s possible for memory problems to stem from factors unrelated to dementia or normal aging. For example, medical conditions, such as depression or blood clots, can cause memory problems. These problems usually go away once the condition is successfully treated.\n\nFactors that may cause memory problems include:\n\nHead injury, such as a concussion\n\nBlood clots, tumors, or infections in the brain\n\nThyroid, kidney, or liver problems\n\nMedication side effects\n\nMental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety\n\nAlcohol or drug misuse\n\nSleep problems\n\nLow levels of important nutrients, such as vitamin B12\n\nNot eating enough healthy foods\n\nMajor, traumatic, or stressful life events can also cause memory problems. For example, someone who has recently retired or who is coping with the death of a spouse may feel sad, lonely, worried, or bored. Stress and negative emotions are powerful. Trying to deal with such life changes and emotions leaves some people confused or forgetful.\n\nThese memory problems from negative emotions are usually temporary and will improve as the stress and emotions fade. Being active, socially engaged, and experiencing a sense of accomplishment by learning new skills can help with both memory and improving mood. If memory problems persist after a few weeks, talk with your doctor as this may be a sign of something more serious.\n\nFinding the cause of memory problems is important for determining the best course of action. Once the cause is diagnosed, you and your doctor can determine the best treatment plan. People with memory problems should make a follow-up appointment to check their memory every six to 12 months."

            "# Stages of Alzheimer's\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease typically progresses slowly in three stages: early, middle and late (sometimes referred to as mild, moderate and severe in a medical context). Since Alzheimer\u2019s affects people in different ways, each person may experience dementia symptoms \u2014 or progress through the stages \u2014 differently.\n\nSubscribe to our e-newsletter to learn how you can help those affected by Alzheimer's.\n\nOverview of disease progression\n\nEarly-stage Alzheimer's (mild)\n\nMiddle-stage Alzheimer's (moderate)\n\nLate-stage Alzheimer's (severe)\n\n## What is mild cognitive impairment?\n\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be an early stage of the disease continuum for Alzheimer's if the hallmark changes in the brain are present. However, not all people with MCI develop dementia.\n\n## Early-stage Alzheimer's (mild)\n\nIn the early stage of Alzheimer's, a person may function independently. He or she may still drive, work and be part of social activities. Despite this, the person may feel as if he or she is having memory lapses, such as forgetting familiar words or the location of everyday objects.\n\nSymptoms may not be widely apparent at this stage, but family and close friends may take notice and a doctor would be able to identify symptoms using certain diagnostic tools.\n\r\nCommon difficulties include:\n\nComing up with the right word or name.\n\nRemembering names when introduced to new people.\n\nHaving difficulty performing tasks in social or work settings.\n\nForgetting material that was just read.\n\nLosing or misplacing a valuable object.\n\nExperiencing increased trouble with planning or organizing.\u200b\r\n\t\n\nYou can live well\n\nDuring the early stage, it\u2019s possible for people with dementia to live well by taking control of their health and wellness, and focusing their energy on aspects of their life that are most meaningful to them. In addition, this is the ideal time to put legal, financial and end-of-life plans in place because the person with dementia will be able to participate in decision-making.\n\nLearn More\n\n## You can live well\n\nDuring the early stage, it\u2019s possible for people with dementia to live well by taking control of their health and wellness, and focusing their energy on aspects of their life that are most meaningful to them. In addition, this is the ideal time to put legal, financial and end-of-life plans in place because the person with dementia will be able to participate in decision-making.\n\n## Middle-stage Alzheimer's (moderate)\n\nMiddle-stage Alzheimer's is typically the longest stage and can last for many years. As the disease progresses, the person with Alzheimer's will require a greater level of care.\n\r\nDuring the middle stage of Alzheimer\u2019s, the dementia symptoms are more pronounced. The person may confuse words, get frustrated or angry, and act in unexpected ways, such as refusing to bathe. Damage to nerve cells in the brain can also make it difficult for the person to express thoughts and perform routine tasks without assistance.\n\n## Home Safety Checklist\n\nDownload, print and keep the checklist handy to prevent dangerous situations and help maximize the person living with dementia's independence for as long as possible.\n\nSymptoms, which vary from person to person, may include:\n\nBeing forgetful of events or personal history.\n\n\u200bFeeling moody or withdrawn, especially in socially or mentally challenging situations.\n\nBeing unable to recall information about themselves like their address or telephone number, and the high school or college they attended.\n\nExperiencing confusion about where they are or what day it is.\n\nRequiring help choosing proper clothing for the season or the occasion.\n\nHaving trouble controlling their bladder and bowels.\n\nExperiencing changes in sleep patterns, such as sleeping during the day and becoming restless at night.\n\nShowing an increased tendency to wander and become lost.\n\nDemonstrating personality and behavioral changes, including suspiciousness and delusions or compulsive, repetitive behavior like hand-wringing or tissue shredding.\n\nIn the middle stage, the person living with Alzheimer\u2019s can still participate in daily activities with assistance. It\u2019s important to find out what the person can still do or find ways to simplify tasks. As the need for more intensive care increases, caregivers may want to consider respite care or an adult day center so they can have a temporary break from caregiving while the person living with Alzheimer\u2019s continues to receive care in a safe environment.\n\r\nLearn more: 10 Signs of Alzheimer's Disease, Diagnosis, Diagnosed with Alzheimer's, Types of Dementia, Daily Care, and Behaviors\n\n## Late-stage Alzheimer's (severe)\n\nIn the final stage of the disease, dementia symptoms are severe. Individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, to carry on a conversation and, eventually, to control movement. They may still say words or phrases, but communicating pain becomes difficult. As memory and cognitive skills continue to worsen, significant personality changes may take place and individuals need extensive care.\n\r\nAt this stage, individuals may:\n\n## Help at any stage\n\nGet easy access to dementia resources, community programs and services through our Community Resource Finder.\n\nRequire around-the-clock assistance with daily personal care.\n\n\u200bLose awareness of recent experiences as well as of their surroundings.\n\nExperience changes in physical abilities, including walking, sitting and, eventually, swallowing.\n\nHave difficulty communicating.\n\nBecome vulnerable to infections, especially pneumonia.\n\nThe person living with Alzheimer\u2019s may not be able to initiate engagement as much during the late stage, but he or she can still benefit from interaction in ways that are appropriate, like listening to relaxing music or receiving reassurance through gentle touch. During this stage, caregivers may want to use support services, such as hospice care, which focus on providing comfort and dignity at the end of life. Hospice can be of great benefit to people in the final stages of Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias and their families.\n\r\nLearn more: Late-Stage Care"

            "# Dementia and language\n\nDementia affects how a person can use language and communicate.\n\nCommunicating and dementia\n\nYou are here: Dementia and language\n\nHow to communicate with a person with dementia\n\nNon-verbal communication and dementia\n\nDementia, sensory impairment and communicating\n\n###### Communicating and language\n\nA person with any type of dementia can have problems with language. This is because dementia can damage the parts of the brain that control language.\n\nHow and when language problems develop will depend on:\n\ntheir personality and the ways they manage these language problems\n\nthe type of dementia they have\n\nthe stage the dementia is at.\n\n## When do people with dementia find it difficult to communicate?\n\nLanguage problems can also vary from day to day, or be more or less of a problem at different times of the day.\u00a0They can be made worse if the person is tired, in pain or unwell. The surroundings can also help with communication, or make it more difficult.\n\nIn some types of dementia \u2013 such as some forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) \u2013 a person may start to have problems with language much earlier than other types of dementia. It is likely to be one of the first symptoms that is noticed.\n\n## How can dementia affect how a person communicates?\n\nDementia can affect how a person communicates and the language they use. They may:\n\nnot be able to find the right words\n\nuse a related word (for example, \u2018book\u2019 instead of \u2018newspaper\u2019)\n\nuse substitutes for words (for example, \u2018thing that you sit on\u2019 instead of \u2018chair\u2019)\n\nnot find any word at all\n\nnot struggle to find words, but use words that have no meaning, or that are jumbled up in the wrong order\n\ngo back to the first language they learned as a child. For example, if they learned English as a second language, they may forget how to speak it.\n\n### Following a conversation\n\nDementia\u00a0affects the way a person thinks, which\u00a0can impact on their ability to respond appropriately or follow a conversation. This could be because they:\n\ndo not understand what you have said\n\nare not able to keep focused\n\nare thinking more slowly\n\nare unable to put the correct words together as a reply.\n\nFor example, they may take longer to process thoughts and work out how to respond to what is being said. They may also move from one topic to another without finishing a sentence as it becomes harder for them to focus.\n\nFor more information on how changes in the brain caused by dementia can affect language, see Dementia and the brain.\n\n## What happens when a person's dementia gets worse?\n\nThere may eventually come a time when the person can no longer communicate as they once did. This can be distressing and frustrating for them and those supporting them, but there are ways to keep communicating. For example, the person may be able to express themselves through body language and other non-verbal ways.\n\n## What else can affect how well a person with dementia can communicate?\n\nCommunication for a person with dementia can be affected by pain, discomfort, illness or the side effects of medication.\n\nIf you notice a sudden change in the person (over hours or days), it could be delirium, which is a medical emergency. You should make an urgent appointment with the GP or call the NHS 111 telephone service. Say that the person has changed suddenly, or no longer seems to be acting like their usual self.\n\nThere are other reasons communicating with a person with dementia can be difficult. For example, the person may:\n\nmake comments that you or others feel are inappropriate for the situation\n\nrepeat themselves or ask the same question over and over\n\nbelieve things which aren\u2019t true.\n\nFor more information on these problems and how to manage them see Changes in behaviour and Caring for a person with dementia: A practical guide."

            "## Diagnosis\n\nAn important part of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease includes being able to explain your symptoms. It may help to get input from a close family member or friend about your symptoms and their impact on your daily life. Tests of memory and thinking skills also help diagnose Alzheimer's disease.\n\nBlood and imaging tests can rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. They also can check for proteins in the brain that are linked to Alzheimer's disease. The tests may help your healthcare team better identify the disease causing dementia symptoms.\n\nIn the past, Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed for certain only after death when plaques and tangles were found while looking at the brain with a microscope. Today, healthcare professionals and researchers are able to diagnose Alzheimer's disease during life with more certainty.\n\nThey do this by using a combination of tests that may include tests for biomarkers. Biomarkers can detect if plaques and tangles are present in the brain. Biomarker tests include specific types of positron emission tomography, also known as PET, scans of the brain. Amyloid and tau proteins also can be measured in the fluid part of the blood or in the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, known as cerebrospinal fluid. Recently, blood biomarker tests have become accurate enough to tell if someone is likely to have amyloid in the brain.\n\nBiomarker tests were mainly used in clinical trials until recently. But healthcare professionals have started using them along with other tests to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Biomarker tests also can let healthcare professionals know if the disease is in the early or later stages.\n\n### Physical and neurological exam\n\nA healthcare professional gives you a physical and neurological exam. This may include testing:\n\nReflexes.\n\nMuscle tone and strength.\n\nAbility to get up from a chair and walk across the room.\n\nSense of sight and hearing.\n\nCoordination.\n\nBalance.\n\n### Lab tests\n\nBlood tests may help rule out other potential causes of memory loss and confusion, such as a thyroid disorder or vitamin levels that are too low.\n\nNewer blood tests can measure levels of beta-amyloid protein and tau protein. But these tests aren't available everywhere and may not be covered by insurance.\n\n### Mental status and neuropsychological testing\n\nYour healthcare professional may give you a brief mental status test to check your memory and other thinking skills. Longer forms of this type of test may provide more details about mental function that can be compared with people of a similar age and education level. These tests can help establish a diagnosis and serve as a starting point to track symptoms in the future.\n\n### Brain scan images for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease\n\nBrain scans known as fluorodeoxyglucose PET, also called FDG PET, may be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. FDG PET scans show areas of the brain where nutrients aren't properly used for energy, known as metabolism. The scans in this image show a healthy brain, a brain with mild cognitive impairment and a brain with Alzheimer's disease. Areas that are black and blue represent healthy brain metabolism. Areas that are green, yellow and red represent worsening brain metabolism as the disease gets worse.\n\nBrain scans known as fluorodeoxyglucose PET, also called FDG PET, may be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease.

Areas that are green, yellow and red represent worsening brain metabolism as the disease gets worse.\n\nImages of the brain look for visible changes related to conditions other than Alzheimer's disease that may cause similar symptoms, such as strokes, injury or tumors. Newer imaging tests can help detect specific brain changes caused by Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. These newer tests are mainly used in major medical centers or in clinical trials.\n\nImaging of brain structures include:\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to produce detailed images of the brain. They may show shrinkage of some brain regions linked to Alzheimer's disease. MRI scans also can rule out other conditions that may be causing symptoms. An MRI is generally preferred to a CT scan to evaluate dementia. MRIs also are done before starting certain Alzheimer's medicines and throughout treatment to monitor for potential side effects.\n\nComputerized tomography (CT). A CT scan, a specialized X-ray technology, produces cross-sectional images of your brain. It's usually used to rule out tumors, strokes and head injuries.\n\nA PET scan test can capture images of the disease process. During a PET scan, a low-level radioactive tracer is injected into the blood to reveal a particular feature in the brain. PET imaging may include:\n\nFluorodeoxyglucose, also called FDG, PET imaging scans show areas of the brain where nutrients aren't properly being used for energy, known as metabolism. Finding patterns in the areas of low metabolism can help distinguish between Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia.\n\nAmyloid PET imaging can measure amyloid plaques in the brain. This test is mainly used in research but may be used if a person has unusual or very early onset of dementia symptoms.\n\nTau PET imaging measures neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.\n\nSometimes other tests may be used to measure amyloid and tau in the cerebrospinal fluid. This may be done if symptoms are quickly getting worse or if dementia is affecting someone at a younger age.\n\n### Future of diagnostic tests\n\nResearch has established that biomarker tests can measure biological signs of disease in the brain. The tests can be used with other tools to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease after symptoms begin. Although these tests can look for signs of Alzheimer's before symptoms begin, the tests aren't being used in people without symptoms. The availability of biomarker tests may vary widely.\n\nGenetic tests aren't recommended for most people who might have Alzheimer's disease. But people with a family history of early-onset Alzheimer's disease may consider being tested. Meet with a genetic counselor to talk about the risks and benefits before getting a genetic test."

The core CSF biomarkers for AD pathophysiology are CSF Abeta42, t-tau and p-tau that are believed to have the highest diagnostic accuracy for early AD diagnosis [6,7,8,9,10]. These accurate biomarkers also allow the detection of preclinical AD, in the absence of evident clinical symptoms. The presymptomatic detection of AD is very important, as it can aid in the initiation of a rapid and effective treatment for the disease. Moreover, other biomarkers such as apoptosis markers, soluble APP, inflammatory and oxidation markers and secretases are studied and believed to have increased future prospects. This review will cover the most common CSF biomarkers that are used in AD diagnosis as well as some novel biomarkers that have been recently proposed and could be used as accurate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of AD.\n\n#### 2.1.1. Beta-Amyloid (1-42) (Abeta42)\n\nAbeta42 is a 42 amino acid peptide that is the main constituent of amyloid plaques, one of the hallmarks of AD. It is derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the help of certain enzymes, \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases, that results in two major A\u03b2 isoforms: A\u03b242 (42 residues long) and A\u03b240 (40 residues long) (Figure 1). A\u03b21-42 is the main component of senile plaques.\n\n##### Figure 1.\n\nAPP Processing in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.\n\nCSF Abeta42 levels are significantly reduced in AD patients compared to normal controls [11,12,13] due to its increased deposition in the amyloid plaques and a significant correlation has been found between increased amounts of amyloid plaques in the cortex and hippocampus and reduced CSF Abeta42 levels [14,15]. Reduced CSF levels of Abeta42 were also observed in other dementia types, such as Lewy body disease [16,17], Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease [18], vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia [19]. However, these findings may be related to mixed pathology with dual pathology and overlap of the above-mentioned diseases. No significant correlation has been found between the duration of the disease and the patients\u2019 MMSE score [20]. Mattsson et al. [21], who studied CSF biomarkers in MCI patients, found that CSF Abeta42 compared to t-tau and p-tau is the most accurate biomarker for the diagnosis of the MCI patients that will convert to AD with 79% sensitivity and 65% specificity. This agrees with van Harten et al. [22], who suggested that Abeta42 is the most accurate predictor of clinical progression in patients with subjective cognitive complaints, and a more recent study by Ewers et al. [23], who found that CSF Abeta42 showed the best diagnostic accuracy among CSF biomarkers.\n\nContrary to most research studies, Jensen et al. [24] observed increased CSF Abeta42 levels in MCI patients compared to controls, but there were no follow-up studies on the MCI patients that converted to AD.\n\nOn the other hand, in other studies, no significant difference was observed in the total CSF Abeta levels in AD patients and healthy controls [25,26], therefore the levels of total Abeta were not considered an accurate AD diagnostic marker.\n\nCSF Abeta42 was also found in the preclinical asymptomatic phase of AD and levels in the lower part of the reference range are strongly associated with future A\u03b2 positivity [27]. In normal subjects, high correlation was observed between blood and CSF Abeta42 levels, whereas no such correlation was observed in MCI and AD patients [28], which is believed to be due to the reduction of CSF Abeta42 levels. A similar study was performed on CSF and blood Abeta42 levels [29], which found no difference in the plasma levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in MCI patients that developed AD compared to stable MCI patients and healthy controls. On the other hand, CSF Abeta42 levels were reduced in MCI patients compared to controls. This difference was attributed by the authors to the fact that there is no correlation between blood and CSF Abeta42 levels. Although plasma Abeta42 levels cannot yet be considered as an independent AD marker, their changes might reflect AD conversion [30]. However, blood Abeta42 levels are not considered to be reliable compared to CSF Abeta42. CSF Abeta oligomers correlated with cognitive decline in MCI and AD patients [31] and, in particular, Abeta40 oligomers were also proposed as a potential biomarker in AD [32]. Moreover, A\u03b2 isoforms (A\u03b21-37 and A\u03b21-38) may help to differentiate AD from frontotemporal and Lewy body dementia [33].\n\n#### 2.1.2. Total Tau Protein (t-Tau)\n\nTau protein is the basic element of the neurofibrillary tangles (all six isoforms are located in these tangles) and is located mainly in the neuraxons, then dendrites and the cell bodies [34], therefore CSF t-tau shows the extent of neuronal damage and neurodegeneration in AD.\n\nIncreased CSF levels of t-tau were observed in MCI patients [11,35] and AD patients [12,13,14] compared to normal subjects. The increase in t-tau levels can be detected from the very early stages of AD and is stable as time goes by [12]. Moreover, it has great sensitivity and specificity in the differential diagnosis of AD from normal aging (93% and 86%, respectively) and depression, where the levels are normal [12]. In recent studies [36,37], elevated levels of t-tau and p-tau were observed in MCI patients that developed AD compared to stable MCI patients and normal control subjects. On the other hand, in stable MCI patients, no significant difference was observed in the protein levels between the exams and compared to healthy control subjects in the time period of 2 years [36]. Ivanoiu et al. [38] studied MCI patients and observed that t-tau levels were correlated more with memory function, whereas Abeta42 levels were correlated with the stage of the disease.\n\nAlthough it seems to be a reliable diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis between MCI, AD and normal subjects, an increase in t-tau levels is not considered an accurate diagnostic marker for AD, because it is also increased in other neurodegenerative diseases [39,40]. In particular, the aggregates of tau protein are the main features of several other tauopathies, including frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. Increased levels of CSF tau protein were also observed in ischemic stroke [41] and trauma.\n\nt-Tau levels are very increased in Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease [42], slightly to moderately increased in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and normal in diseases without neurodegeneration [43]. Moreover, t-tau and p-tau may be used for differential diagnosis of MCI from other diseases such as major depression [44]. A correlation between the CSF levels of t-tau and newly used techniques for AD diagnosis was sought. According to Toolboom et al. [45], the positive association between (18)F-FDDNP and CSF t-tau suggested that a part of the specific signal of (18)F-FDDNP in AD patients is due to tangle formation. A similar positive relationship between CSF tau/p-tau (181) and the amount of cortical amyloid was also observed [46].\n\n#### 2.1.3. Phosphorylated t-Protein (p-Tau)\n\nThe abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein has toxic actions and negatively regulates its ability to stimulate microtubule assembly, leading to detachment of tau from microtubules and its accumulation into neurofibrillary tangles (Figure 2).\n\n##### Figure 2.\n\nPhosphorylation of Tau protein. The red arrow shows how Tau protein stabilizes microtubules.\n\nIt is caused, to an extent, by the loss of balance between the activities of t-kinase and t-phosphatase [47,48]. Several forms of p-tau such as 396/404 [49], phosphorylated tau protein in threonin 181 [50] and phosphorylated tau protein in threonin-231 [51] were studied with an ELISA method. Ishiguro et al. [52] observed that p-tau protein levels were significantly higher in AD patients compared to healthy subjects and the discrimination between the two groups was more accurate using p-tau than t-tau. Therefore, increased levels of p-tau are considered a more reliable marker in AD early diagnosis. p-Tau is not a simple marker of axonal damage like t-tau, but is more closely related to AD pathophysiology and NFT formation. Therefore, the combination of the two tau forms is more accurate in AD diagnosis. Together with isoprostane and the volume of the hippocampus, they are useful markers in the differential diagnosis of MCI patients from healthy subjects, whereas the increase in p-tau levels and the reduction in Abeta levels are correlated with volume loss in the hippocampus [53]. In particular, p-tau in threonin-231 (P-tau231) is considered to be the most accurate marker of MCI conversion to AD [54] with 80% specificity and 80% total diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing the MCI patients that will later convert to AD. Recent studies have demonstrated that it increases early in the development of AD pathophysiology [55]. Other p-tau epitopes phosphorylated at other sites such as p-tau217 and p-tau231 have emerged over recent years to be at least as useful as p-tau231.\n\n### 2.2. Combination of Biomarkers\n\nThe combination of CSF Abeta42, t-tau and p-tau levels has 95% sensitivity and 83% specificity in determining the patients that will develop AD [26]. Similar results were observed by Andreasen et al. [56] and Hampel et al. [57] who observed total diagnostic accuracy of over 80%. Increased levels of CSF t-tau and p-tau together with decreased levels of CSF Abeta42 create a typical AD biomarker profile and are found in the majority of AD patients. The combination of CSF proteins together with other diagnostic procedures can increase the accuracy of AD diagnosis. Low CSF Abeta42 and high t-tau levels combined with medial temporal atrophy are associated with increased risk of MCI conversion to dementia, mostly AD. In particular, the diagnostic value of CSF markers was 3-fold that of the medial temporal lobe alone [58].\n\nBiomarker ratios were also studied and were frequently found to be superior compared to their individual constituents. The ratio of CSF t-tau/Abeta42 protein shows promising results in predicting future MCI [59] and dementia [60] in cognitively normal older adults. Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity values of this ratio for AD diagnosis are 85.7% and 84.6%, respectively [61].\n\nCSF A\u03b240/A\u03b242 and CSF A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratios increase the differential diagnosis of AD from other dementia types such as frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia. They were found to be significantly lower compared to other dementias [62]. In large-scale MCI studies [55,63], a CSF AD profile for t-tau and Abeta42 was proposed with a high accuracy of AD prediction in amnestic MCI patients (OR 26.8, 95% CI 1.6\u2013456.4). Models that can accurately predict AD diagnosis based on CSF Abeta42 and p-tau were proposed [64,65].\n\nSeveral studies have suggested the combination of CSF proteins and event-related potential (ERP) waveforms as an accurate diagnostic marker of MCI conversion to AD [66,67,68]. The combination of CSF and MRI markers was also studied with an accuracy of 91.8% in distinguishing between AD patients and controls. The combination was better than using either CSF or MRI biomarkers alone [68]. A low variability was observed in the CSF biomarkers during the day in AD patients and, consequently, continuous CSF measurement is considered accurate [69]. Therefore, combinations of CSF biomarkers can discriminate AD patients from normal subjects better than if they are used individually."

            "## FDA-approved drugs for Alzheimer's\n\nThe FDA has approved medications that fall into two categories: drugs that change disease progression in people living with early Alzheimer's disease, and drugs that may temporarily mitigate some symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia.\n\r\nWhen considering any treatment, it is important to have a conversation with a health care professional to determine whether it is appropriate. A clinician who is experienced in using these types of medications should monitor people who are taking them and ensure that the recommended guidelines are strictly observed.\n\n### Drugs that change disease progression\n\nDrugs in this category slow disease progression by going after the underlying biology of the disease process. They aim to slow the decline of memory and thinking, as well as function, in people living with Alzheimer's disease.\n\n#### Amyloid-targeting approaches\n\nAnti-amyloid treatments work by removing beta-amyloid, a protein that accumulates into plaques, from the brain. Each works differently and targets beta-amyloid at a different stage of plaque formation.\n\r\nThese treatments change the course of the disease in a meaningful way for people in the early stages, giving them more time to participate in daily life and live independently. Clinical trial participants who received anti-amyloid treatments experienced reduction in cognitive decline observed through measures of cognition and function.\n\r\nExamples of cognition measures include:\n\nMemory.\n\nMemory.\n\nOrientation.\n\nOrientation.\n\nExamples of functional measures include:\n\nConducting personal finances.\n\nConducting personal finances.\n\nPerforming household chores such as cleaning.\n\nPerforming household chores such as cleaning.\n\nAnti-amyloid treatments do have side effects. These treatments can cause serious allergic reactions. Side effects can also include amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), infusion-related reactions, headaches and falls.\n\nARIA is a common side effect that does not usually cause symptoms but can be serious. It is typically a temporary swelling in areas of the brain that usually resolves over time. Some people may also have small spots of bleeding in or on the surface of the brain with the swelling, although most people with swelling in areas of the brain do not have symptoms. Some may have symptoms of ARIA such as headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion and vision changes.\n\r\nSome people have a genetic risk factor (ApoE \u03b54 gene carriers) that may cause an increased risk for ARIA. The FDA encourages that testing for ApoE \u03b54 status should be performed prior to initiation of treatment to inform the risk of developing ARIA. Prior to testing, doctors should discuss with patients the risk of ARIA and the implications of genetic testing results.\n\r\nThese are not all the possible side effects, and individuals should talk with their doctors to develop a treatment plan that is right for them, including weighing the benefits and risks of all approved therapies.\n\nDonanemab (Kisunla\u2122)\nDonanemab (Kisunla) is an anti-amyloid antibody intravenous (IV) infusion therapy delivered every four weeks. It has received traditional approval from the FDA to treat early Alzheimer's disease, including people living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease who have confirmation of elevated beta-amyloid in the brain. There is no safety or effectiveness data on initiating treatment at earlier or later stages of the disease than were studied.\n\r\nDonanemab was the third therapy to demonstrate that removing beta-amyloid from the brain reduces cognitive and functional decline in people living with early Alzheimer's.\n\nLecanemab (Leqembi\u00ae)\nLecanemab (Leqembi) is an anti-amyloid antibody intravenous (IV) infusion therapy that is delivered every two weeks. It has received traditional approval from the FDA to treat early Alzheimer's disease, including people living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease who have confirmation of elevated beta-amyloid in the brain. There is no safety or effectiveness data on initiating treatment at earlier or later stages of the disease than were studied.\n\r\nLecanemab was the second therapy to demonstrate that removing beta-amyloid from the brain reduces cognitive and functional decline in people living with early Alzheimer's.\n\n#### Cognitive symptoms (memory and thinking)\n\nAs Alzheimer\u2019s progresses, brain cells die and connections among cells are lost, causing cognitive symptoms to worsen. While these medications do not stop the damage Alzheimer\u2019s causes to brain cells, they may help lessen or stabilize symptoms for a limited time by affecting certain chemicals involved in carrying messages among and between the brain's nerve cells.\n\nThe following medications are prescribed to treat symptoms related to memory and thinking.\n\nCholinesterase inhibitors\r\nCholinesterase (KOH-luh-NES-ter-ays) inhibitors are prescribed to treat symptoms related to memory, thinking, language, judgment and other thought processes. These medications prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine (a-SEA-til-KOHlean), a chemical messenger important for memory and learning. These drugs support communication between nerve cells.\n\r\nThe cholinesterase inhibitors most commonly prescribed are:\n\nBenzgalantamine (Zunveyl\u00ae): approved for mild-to-moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.\n\nDonepezil (Aricept\u00ae): approved for mild-to-severe dementia due to Alzhiemer's disease.\n\nGalantamine (Razadyne\u00ae): approved for mild-to-moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.\n\nRivastigmine (Exelon\u00ae): approved for mild-to-moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease as well as mild-to-moderate dementia due to Parkinson's disease.\n\nThough generally well-tolerated, if side effects occur, they commonly include diarrhea, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and increased frequency of bowel movements.\n\nGlutamate regulators\r\nGlutamate regulators are prescribed to improve memory, attention, reason, language and the ability to perform simple tasks. This type of drug works by regulating the activity of glutamate, a different chemical messenger that helps the brain process information. This drug is known as:\n\nMemantine (Namenda\u00ae): approved for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Can cause side effects, including headache, constipation, confusion and dizziness.\n\nMemantine (Namenda\u00ae): approved for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Can cause side effects, including headache, constipation, confusion and dizziness.\n\nCholinesterase inhibitor + glutamate regulator\r\nThis type of drug is a combination of a cholinesterase inhibitor and a glutamate regulator.\n\nDonepezil and memantine (Namzaric\u00ae): approved for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, increased frequency of bowel movements, headache, constipation, confusion and dizziness.\n\nDonepezil and memantine (Namzaric\u00ae): approved for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, increased frequency of bowel movements, headache, constipation, confusion and dizziness.\n\n#### Non-cognitive symptoms (behavioral and psychological symptoms)\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s affects more than just memory and thinking. A person\u2019s quality of life may be impacted by a variety of behavioral and psychological symptoms that accompany dementia, such as sleep disturbances, agitation, hallucinations and delusions. Some medications focus on treating these non-cognitive symptoms for a time, though it is important to try non-drug strategies to manage behaviors before adding medications.\n\r\nThe FDA has approved one drug to address symptoms of insomnia that has been tested in people living with dementia and one that treats agitation.\n\nOrexin receptor antagonist\r\nPrescribed to treat insomnia, this drug inhibits the activity of orexin, a type of neurotransmitter involved in the sleep-wake cycle:\n\nSuvorexant (Belsomra\u00ae): approved for treatment of insomnia and has been shown in clinical trials to be effective for people living with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Possible side effects include, but are not limited to: risk of impaired alertness and motor coordination (including impaired driving), worsening of depression or suicidal thinking, complex sleep behaviors (such as sleep-walking and sleep-driving), sleep paralysis and compromised respiratory function.\n\nSuvorexant (Belsomra\u00ae): approved for treatment of insomnia and has been shown in clinical trials to be effective for people living with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Possible side effects include, but are not limited to: risk of impaired alertness and motor coordination (including impaired driving), worsening of depression or suicidal thinking, complex sleep behaviors (such as sleep-walking and sleep-driving), sleep paralysis and compromised respiratory function.\n\nAtypical antipsychotics\r\nAtypical antipsychotics are a group of antipsychotic drugs that target the serotonin and dopamine chemical pathways in the brain. These drugs are largely used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and as add-on therapies for major depressive disorder. The FDA requires that all atypical antipsychotics carry a safety warning that the medication has been associated with an increased risk of death in older patients with dementia-related psychosis.\n\r\nMany atypical antipsychotic medications are used \"off-label\" to treat dementia-related behaviors, and there is currently only one FDA-approved atypical antipsychotic to treat agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's. It is important to try non-drug strategies to manage non-cognitive symptoms \u2014 like agitation \u2014 before adding medications.\n\nBrexpiprazole (Rexulti\u00ae): approved for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Possible side effects include, but are not limited to: weight gain, sleepiness, dizziness, common cold symptoms, and restlessness or feeling like you need to move. Warning for serious side effects: increased risk of death in older adults with dementia-related psychosis. Rexulti is not approved for the treatment of people with dementia-related psychosis without agitation that may happen with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.\n\nBrexpiprazole (Rexulti\u00ae): approved for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Possible side effects include, but are not limited to: weight gain, sleepiness, dizziness, common cold symptoms, and restlessness or feeling like you need to move.

This activity describes the indications, action, and contraindications for cholinesterase inhibitors in treating dementia disorders and other uses within other specialties. Moreover, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the management of patients undergoing treatments requiring cholinesterase inhibitors.\n\nObjectives:\nIdentify the indications for cholinesterase inhibitor use.Describe the most common adverse effects associated with cholinesterase inhibitor use.Summarize the risks associated with initiating cholinesterase use.Outline the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors.\nAccess free multiple choice questions on this topic.\n\nIdentify the indications for cholinesterase inhibitor use.\n\nDescribe the most common adverse effects associated with cholinesterase inhibitor use.\n\nSummarize the risks associated with initiating cholinesterase use.\n\nOutline the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors.\n\n## Indications\n\nCholinesterase inhibitors also have the following names: acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors or anticholinesterases. They are a group of drugs that block the normal breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh) into acetate and choline and increase both the\u00a0levels and duration of actions of acetylcholine found in the central and peripheral nervous system. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have a variety of indications. Most commonly, their use is in treating neurogenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and\u00a0Lewy body dementia. Different physiological processes in these degenerative disorders destroy cells that produce ACh and reduce cholinergic transmission in different regions of the brain. The cholinesterase inhibitor drugs inhibit\u00a0AChE activity and maintain the ACh level by decreasing its breakdown rate.[1]\n\nAlso, cholinesterase inhibitors have frequent use in patients with myasthenia gravis. The raised level of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction leads\u00a0to increased activation of ACh receptors found on post-synaptic membranes resulting in improved\u00a0muscle activation, contraction, and strength.\n\nAt the end of surgeries,\u00a0cholinesterase inhibitors,\u00a0most commonly neostigmine, are administered to reverse the\u00a0effects of nondepolarizing muscle agents such as rocuronium.[2][3][4][5][6]\n\nCholinesterase inhibitors are also necessary to administer when\u00a0anticholinergic poisoning is suspected. Symptoms of\u00a0anticholinergic poisoning include vasodilation, anhidrosis, mydriasis, delirium, and urinary retention.[7]\n\nOther less common indications of cholinesterase inhibitors include\u00a0treating patients diagnosed with certain\u00a0psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and treatment of glaucoma by relieving aqueous humor pressure.[8]\n\n## Mechanism of Action\n\nCholinesterase inhibitors function by inhibiting cholinesterase from\u00a0hydrolyzing acetylcholine into its components of acetate and choline'; this allows for an increase in the availability and duration of action\u00a0of\u00a0acetylcholine in\u00a0neuromuscular junctions.\u00a0The cholinesterase enzyme has\u00a0two active sites: an anionic site formed by tryptophan and an esteractic site formed by serine. Cholinesterase inhibitors such as organophosphates inhibit cholinesterase\u00a0from cleaving acetylcholine\u00a0by interacting with the serine esteractic site. As a result, acetylcholine will continue to\u00a0accumulate and activate associated receptors.[9]\n\nCholinesterase inhibitors classify as reversible, irreversible, or pseudo-reversible. Reversible cholinesterase inhibitors are generally utilized for therapeutic purposes. In contrast, irreversible and pseudo-reversible inhibitors are often used in pesticides and biowarfare (nerve agents).[10][11]",

            "#### Cognitive symptoms (memory and thinking)\n\nAs Alzheimer\u2019s progresses, brain cells die and connections among cells are lost, causing cognitive symptoms to worsen. While these medications do not stop the damage Alzheimer\u2019s causes to brain cells, they may help lessen or stabilize symptoms for a limited time by affecting certain chemicals involved in carrying messages among and between the brain's nerve cells.\n\nThe following medications are prescribed to treat symptoms related to memory and thinking.\n\nCholinesterase inhibitors\r\nCholinesterase (KOH-luh-NES-ter-ays) inhibitors are prescribed to treat symptoms related to memory, thinking, language, judgment and other thought processes.

            "## Continuing Education Activity\n\nMemantine acts as an antagonist for the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtype of the glutamate receptor. Memantine slows the neurotoxicity involved in Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Memantine is an uncompetitive, low-affinity, open-channel blocker that blocks the extrasynaptic NMDA receptor (NMDAR) that selectively enters the receptor-associated ion channel during its open state. As a result, the drug prevents the disruption of normal synaptic transmission, safeguarding against further damage caused by excitotoxicity-induced neuronal cell death. This is why memantine is commonly used in combination with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer dementia, which is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nMemantine blocks the NMDAR subtype of glutamate receptors, preventing the overactivation of glutamine receptors\u00a0and\u00a0facilitating\u00a0normal activity. The drug's antagonistic effects counteract an excessively active glutaminergic system in the central nervous system, believed to contribute to the neurotoxicity observed in Alzheimer disease. This activity reviews the pharmacology, indications, adverse effects, drug interactions, and contraindications of memantine, highlighting the collaborative efforts of interprofessional healthcare teams in treating patients with dementia.\n\nObjectives:\nIdentify appropriate candidates for memantine therapy based on the diagnosis of moderate to severe Alzheimer dementia and in accordance with FDA-approved indications.Screen patients for contraindications and potential risks associated with memantine, considering factors such as comorbidities and medication interactions.Select suitable combinations of memantine with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, recognizing the synergistic effects in the treatment of Alzheimer dementia.Coordinate with the interprofessional healthcare team to develop and implement a holistic care plan, considering both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer management.\nAccess free multiple choice questions on this topic.\n\nIdentify appropriate candidates for memantine therapy based on the diagnosis of moderate to severe Alzheimer dementia and in accordance with FDA-approved indications.\n\nScreen patients for contraindications and potential risks associated with memantine, considering factors such as comorbidities and medication interactions.\n\nSelect suitable combinations of memantine with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, recognizing the synergistic effects in the treatment of Alzheimer dementia.\n\nCoordinate with the interprofessional healthcare team to develop and implement a holistic care plan, considering both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to Alzheimer management.\n\n## Indications\n\nMemantine is an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subtype of glutamate receptor. Memantine is used to slow\u00a0the neurotoxicity involved in Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.[1] Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Among the receptors activated by glutamate is the NMDAR, which is crucial for\u00a0processes such as learning and memory. Excessive activation of NMDARs is associated with neuronal loss or damage, contributing to acute and chronic neurological disorders, including dementia. However, maintaining physiological NMDAR activity is essential for normal neuronal function. Agents that completely block NMDAR activity would result in undesirable clinical adverse effects.\n\nMemantine blocks the NMDAR subtype of glutamate receptors, preventing the overactivation of glutamine receptors\u00a0and\u00a0facilitating\u00a0normal activity. The drug's antagonistic\u00a0effects counteract an excessively active glutaminergic system in the central nervous system, believed to contribute to the neurotoxicity observed in Alzheimer disease.[2][3]\n\nPharmacologic Class\n\nNMDAR antagonist\n\nDescription\n\nChemical name: 1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane hydrochloride\n\nMolecular formula: C12H21N\u2022HCl\n\nMolecular weight: 215.76 g\n\nFDA-Approved Indication\n\nMemantine is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Alzheimer dementia.[4]\n\nOff-Label\u00a0Uses\n\nMemantine may be utilized off-label for conditions such as mild-to-moderate Alzheimer dementia and vascular dementia, chronic pain, psychiatric disorders, and mild cognitive impairment, as well as in cases of brain metastases in patients with a favorable prognosis undergoing whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) or hippocampal avoidance WBRT, as recommended by the American Society for Radiation Oncology.[5]\n\nDiagnosis of Alzheimer Disease\n\nThe DSM-5 criteria for diagnosis include the following characteristics:\n\nEvidence of significant cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in one or more cognitive domains: complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, or social cognition.\n\nThe cognitive deficits interfere with independence in everyday activities.\n\nThe cognitive deficits do not occur only in the context of delirium.\n\nAnother mental disorder does not better explain the cognitive deficits.\n\nThe onset is an insidious and gradual progression of impairment in at least\u00a02 cognitive domains:\nEvidence of a causative Alzheimer\u00a0disease genetic mutation from family history or genetic testing.All 3 of the following:\u00a0Clear evidence of a decline in memory and learning and one or more other domains;\u00a0steadily progressive, gradual decline in cognition, without extended plateaus; and\u00a0no evidence of mixed etiology due to other neurodegenerative disorders or cerebrovascular disease.\n\nEvidence of a causative Alzheimer\u00a0disease genetic mutation from family history or genetic testing.\n\nAll 3 of the following:\u00a0Clear evidence of a decline in memory and learning and one or more other domains;\u00a0steadily progressive, gradual decline in cognition, without extended plateaus; and\u00a0no evidence of mixed etiology due to other neurodegenerative disorders or cerebrovascular disease.\n\nRole of Memantine in Alzheimer Dementia\n\nAlzheimer disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid-beta protein, an intracellular neurofibrillary tangle composed of a hyperphosphorylated protein in the brain. There is a decrease in acetylcholine synthesis and impaired cortical cholinergic function in patients with Alzheimer\u00a0dementia. Cholinesterase inhibitors (like donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) in dementia provide symptomatic relief by inhibiting cholinesterase at the synaptic cleft and increasing cholinergic transmission. However, the mechanism of action of memantine is distinct from those of cholinergic agents and is neuroprotective.\n\nMemantine is an uncompetitive, low-affinity, open-channel blocker that blocks the extrasynaptic NMDAR that selectively enters the receptor-associated ion channel during its open state. As a result,\u00a0the drug\u00a0prevents the disruption of normal synaptic transmission, safeguarding against further damage caused by excitotoxicity-induced neuronal cell death. This is why memantine is commonly used in combination with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer dementia.[2][6]\n\n## Mechanism of Action\n\nMemantine is an uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors in the CNS. Alzheimer disease is believed to be caused by overstimulation of glutamate, the primary excitatory amino acid in the CNS, resulting in excitotoxicity and neuronal degeneration. The NMDAR is a voltage-gated cation channel blocked by magnesium ions in the physiologic unstimulated state. Stimulated magnesium is displaced, allowing calcium influx and activation. In Alzheimer disease, pathologic overstimulation of the receptor causes a chronically active state. Memantine counteracts the excessive stimulation.[1]\n\nMemantine also exhibits antagonist activity at the serotonergic type 3 (5-HT3) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Memantine has no activity at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), benzodiazepine, dopamine, adrenergic, histamine, or glycine receptors or for voltage-dependent calcium, sodium, or potassium channels.[1]\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nMemantine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics behavior over the therapeutic dose range.\n\nAbsorption:\u00a0The Cmax and AUC0-24 values of memantine were 48% and 33% higher for the extended-release dosage regimen when comparing once daily 28 mg memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules to twice 10 mg daily memantine hydrochloride. Memantine\u00a0peak plasma concentration occurs around 9 to 12 hours post-dose after multiple doses of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules. Whether taken intact or sprinkled on applesauce, there is no difference in the absorption of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules.\n\nWhether memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules are taken with food or on an empty stomach, there is no difference in the Cmax or AUC. However, peak plasma concentrations are achieved about 18 hours and 25 hours after administration with food and on an empty stomach, respectively.\n\nDistribution:\u00a0The plasma protein binding of memantine is 45%. The average volume of distribution of memantine is 9 to 11 L/kg.\n\nMetabolism:\u00a0Memantine is partially metabolized in the liver. The hepatic microsomal enzyme system, specifically CYP450, does not significantly impact the breakdown of memantine.\n\nElimination:\u00a0Most of the memantine is eliminated through urine without undergoing any changes. The elimination half-life is about 60 to 80 hours. Approximately 48% of the drug administered is eliminated unchanged in the urine. The remaining portion is transformed into\u00a03 polar metabolites with minimal NMDAR antagonistic activity. These metabolites include the N-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy-memantine, and 1-nitroso-deaminated memantine. 74% of the administered dose is excreted as the sum of the parent drug and the N-glucuronide conjugate. Renal clearance involves active tubular secretion moderated by pH-dependent tubular reabsorption."

            "# Alzheimer's disease: Learn More \u2013 Non-drug interventions for Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\nLast Update: March 29, 2022; Next update: 2025.\n\nThere are a number of options for treating Alzheimer's disease other than medication. These include memory training, psychosocial activation and physical exercise programs. Some of these methods could possibly improve people\u2019s cognitive performance and increase their independence.\n\nAs Alzheimer\u2019s disease progresses, it becomes more and more difficult for people to do everyday activities on their own. They become forgetful and increasingly have problems expressing themselves in words. Their orientation in space and time gets worse and their personality changes. This makes good-quality care and emotional and social support all the more important: People who have Alzheimer's need loving and stable relationships and an understanding environment.\n\nThere is currently no cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and there is no way to stop it from getting worse. But there are medications and non-drug interventions that aim to delay the loss of mental abilities, to help people stay independent in everyday life for longer, and to improve their quality of life. These non-drug interventions include memory and orientation exercises, art therapy, aromatherapy and music therapy, and contact with animals, as well as caregiver training for family members.\n\nIt's often difficult to say how beneficial these common interventions are, though. A few of them have been very well studied. But there is hardly any high-quality research on many of the non-drug interventions.\n\n## Which non-drug interventions are suited for which people?\n\nThat depends on things like the person\u2019s symptoms, how far the disease has progressed, and the causes of certain behaviors. Different therapy goals can influence the decision too. The person's life history, personality and current life circumstances play an important role as well.\n\nIt\u2019s important to make sure that interventions don't demand too much of the person and aren\u2019t stressful, and that they allow a sense of achievement. Which non-drug interventions are most suitable for a specific individual and improve that person's quality of life is best found out with the help of specialists, for example in the fields of medicine, nursing, psychology, social work, occupational therapy and physiotherapy.\n\n## What are cognitive therapies?\n\nThe term \u201ccognitive\u201d is used as a collective name for everything that has to do with the mental abilities of an individual, for example perception, thinking and remembering. There are various types of cognitive interventions for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s. They may include things like arithmetic problems, or exercises in which series of numbers are to be completed, or in which images have to be remembered and recognized. There are also exercises involving words and puzzles, as well as interventions in which people practice doing everyday things like shopping. These exercises are offered in either one-on-one or group sessions which usually take place one or two times per week, with each session lasting 30 to 90 minutes.\n\nAnother widely used intervention is called reality orientation training. This approach aims to help improve people\u2019s orientation in space and time. It involves repeatedly giving people with Alzheimer's basic information such as their name, the date or the time. This is done in conversations or by placing orientation aids around the person\u2019s home. Orientation aids might include things like large calendars, or door signs with the names of the rooms on them.\n\n## Can cognitive techniques help with Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\n\nStudies suggest that cognitive interventions can temporarily improve mental performance and language abilities in mild and moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But they don't improve a person's ability to take care of themselves. It is not clear whether the therapies can improve mood or quality of life.\n\nA small number of studies also analyzed therapies where participants trained things like their language skills and memory on a computer. These \"web-based cognitive techniques\" were only able to improve attention spans a little, though. They hardly had a noticeable effect on memory and everyday abilities.\n\nSide effects of cognitive approaches can\u2019t be ruled out. For instance, it could be very frustrating for someone with Alzheimer's if they fail to complete an exercise again and again. Reality orientation training can be too much for people, making them feel even more confused. Some specialists view this type of training critically because it sometimes involves repeatedly pointing out the obvious, which can be patronizing.\n\nIt's important for cognitive approaches to be adapted to suit individual options and needs and overseen by a professional.\n\n## What are the effects of physical, mental and social stimulation?\n\nThese interventions focus on different types of activities, such as discussion groups on various topics, preparing meals together, practical things like brushing your teeth, making coffee or writing letters \u2013 but also physical activities to improve strength, endurance and balance, as well as art and music.\n\nResearch shows that social activities can improve the quality of life of people with Alzheimer's and their family members. They can help prevent Alzheimer\u2019s-related apathy. They can also reduce the amount of care needed. No studies carried out thus far have been able to say whether these kinds of activities can also help with problems like challenging behavior (such as aggression or severe restlessness).\n\nJust like with other people, physical activity has health benefits for people with Alzheimer\u2019s. It\u2019s important to ensure that older people are able to stay active so they don\u2019t become bedridden, for instance. Studies have shown that people with Alzheimer\u2019s can stay mobile for longer if they take part in exercise programs. Combining different types of exercise to improve strength, agility and balance might help them perform everyday activities on their own for longer.\n\nSuch exercise programs may include things like walking, strength-building exercises and endurance exercises. People have about two to three exercise sessions per week, lasting between 30 and 60 minutes each. Exercise and sports can sometimes be too much for people and lead to injuries, so it\u2019s important to adapt exercise programs based on a person\u2019s abilities and needs.\n\nThe effect of sport and exercise on the mental performance of people with Alzheimer's is still unclear. Studies have produced inconsistent results.\n\n## How do emotion-oriented treatments work?\n\nEmotion-oriented treatment approaches focus on the feelings, values and experiences of people who have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and aim to improve their quality of life. One example is validation therapy. Here the caregivers use special communication techniques, being sure to create an atmosphere of closeness and care when interacting with the person who has Alzheimer\u2019s. The caregivers do not judge the behavior of those with the disease, and accept them and their feelings as they are. The aim is to make them feel understood, safe and comfortable.\n\nAn example: A woman with Alzheimer\u2019s can't find her purse and is absolutely sure that it must have been stolen. She is angry and wants to call the police. Telling her that she always forgets where her purse is would just make her even angrier at that point. In a validation approach, the fact that her purse is missing would not be questioned. The caregiver might be understanding and suggest a solution, such as looking for the purse together before contacting the police.\n\nReminiscence therapy is another kind of emotion-oriented treatment. The word \u201creminiscence\u201d comes from the Latin word for remembering. In reminiscence therapy, people who have Alzheimer\u2019s are encouraged to talk about topics such as their hometown, school days or work. This is done in individual or group settings. The aim is to improve their mental abilities as well as their quality of life, and lessen the psychological effects of Alzheimer\u2019s, such as depression. Studies point out that reminiscence therapy can improve mood and mental performance, even though the studies found those effects to be rather minor.\n\n## Can occupational therapy or psychotherapy help?\n\nOccupational therapy is an effective treatment method to train everyday abilities, such as getting dressed and housework. Occupational therapists help people with Alzheimer's to keep on living as independently as possible. They offer a number of exercises and activities, provide advice, and suggest adjustments in everyday life. Occupational therapy can also include concentration and memory training.\n\nPsychological treatment may be considered if the disease causes severe mental health issues. It might aim to help people cope with the illness better and remain independent in everyday life for as long as possible. Anxiety disorders and depression are also common in people with Alzheimer's and can be treated with psychotherapy.\n\n## What other non-drug interventions are there?\n\nA large number of other non-drug interventions are available for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, such as aromatherapy. It is thought to help relax people who are restless or aggressive. Studies carried out so far have not been able to find any benefits to this treatment, though. The benefits of animal-assisted therapies, with dogs for instance, are also not clear."

            "# What Do We Know About Diet and Prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease?\n\nCan eating a specific food or following a particular diet help prevent or delay dementia caused by Alzheimer\u2019s disease? Many studies suggest that what we eat affects the aging brain\u2019s ability to think and remember. These findings have led to research on general eating patterns and whether a person\u2019s diet might make a difference.\n\nHealthy eating patterns have been associated with cognitive benefits in studies, but more research is needed \u2014 and is underway \u2014 to determine if what we eat can prevent or delay Alzheimer\u2019s or age-related cognitive decline.\n\nHow could what we eat affect our brains? It\u2019s possible that eating a certain diet affects biological mechanisms, such as oxidative stress and inflammation, that underlie Alzheimer\u2019s. Eating a certain diet might increase specific nutrients that may protect the brain through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It may inhibit beta-amyloid deposits, which are found in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s, or improve cellular metabolism in ways that protect against the disease.\n\nOr perhaps a person\u2019s diet works indirectly by affecting other Alzheimer\u2019s risk factors, such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. For example, the typical Western diet increases cardiovascular disease risk, possibly contributing to faster brain aging. A growing area of research focuses on the relationship between gut microbes \u2014 tiny organisms in the digestive system \u2014 and aging-related processes that lead to Alzheimer\u2019s. The important role of physical activity and exercise, and how this interacts with diet, cardiovascular health, and brain health must also be considered.\n\n## Understanding the Mediterranean and MIND diets\n\nBefore starting any dietary change, it\u2019s important to talk with your health care provider. They can provide personalized advice that accounts for your health history and medical conditions.\n\nWith that in mind, there are two diets that research has shown may hold potential benefits for cognitive health, but the evidence is mixed.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, fish and other seafood, unsaturated fats such as olive oils, and low amounts of red meat, eggs, and sweets.\n\nThe MIND (Mediterranean\u2013DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet is a hybrid of the Mediterranean and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. Several studies have shown that treating and reducing high blood pressure may help reduce the risk of dementia. Similar to the Mediterranean diet, the MIND diet features vegetables, especially green leafy vegetables; berries over other fruit; whole grains; beans; nuts; one or more weekly servings of fish; and olive oil. It also limits servings of red meat, sweets, cheese, butter/margarine, and fast/fried food.\n\nSome, but not all observational studies have shown that the Mediterranean and MIND diets are associated with a lower risk for dementia compared to a Western-style diet, which typically contains more red meat, saturated fats, and sugar.\n\nHowever, a recent clinical trial assigned 600 older adults with a family history of dementia to either a MIND-diet group or a control-diet group. Results showed that participants who followed the MIND diet had only small improvements in cognition that were similar to those who followed a control diet of mild caloric restriction.\n\nPrevious research on these diets points to their potential to slow cognitive decline, lower risk for dementia, and reduce related damage to the brain. Here\u2019s a look at the evidence:\n\nTo find out more on the diet and dementia connection, scientists continue to conduct clinical trials to shed more light on any cause and effect. (View a list of trials currently recruiting participants at the end of this article.)\n\nObservational studies of more than 900 dementia-free older adults found that closely following the MIND diet was associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer\u2019s and a slower rate of cognitive decline.In March 2023, scientists completed a study of the brains of about 600 older adults who died at an average age of 91. Brain autopsies found that people who had reported sticking to a Mediterranean or MIND diet showed less evidence of Alzheimer\u2019s pathologies, including tau tangles and amyloid plaques.In one observational study of 116 cognitively normal adults, those who followed a Mediterranean diet had thicker cortical brain regions than those who did not. These brain regions shrink in people with Alzheimer\u2019s, so having thicker regions could mean there\u2019s a cognitive benefit.A follow-up observational study showed lower glucose metabolism and higher levels of beta-amyloid protein \u2014 both seen in Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 in people who did not follow the Mediterranean diet closely, compared to those who did.An analysis of diet and other factors found that, after an average of 4.5 years, people who adhered most closely to the MIND diet had a 53% reduced rate of Alzheimer\u2019s compared to those who did not follow the diet closely.In a similar study, following the MIND diet was associated with a substantial slowing of cognitive decline during an average of almost five years.The Age-Related Eye Disease Studies originally looked at diet and eye disease. Further analysis by the researchers showed that people who followed the Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of developing cognitive problems while maintaining a higher level of cognitive function.\n\nIn March 2023, scientists completed a study of the brains of about 600 older adults who died at an average age of 91. Brain autopsies found that people who had reported sticking to a Mediterranean or MIND diet showed less evidence of Alzheimer\u2019s pathologies, including tau tangles and amyloid plaques.\n\nIn one observational study of 116 cognitively normal adults, those who followed a Mediterranean diet had thicker cortical brain regions than those who did not.

Further analysis by the researchers showed that people who followed the Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of developing cognitive problems while maintaining a higher level of cognitive function.\n\n## What do we know about individual foods?\n\nMany foods \u2014 blueberries, leafy greens, and curcumin (found in the spice turmeric), to name a few \u2014 have been studied for their potential cognitive benefit. These foods have been thought to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, or other properties that might help protect the brain. However, so far, there is no evidence that eating or avoiding a specific food can prevent Alzheimer\u2019s or age-related cognitive decline.\n\nStill, scientists continue to look for clues. A recent study showed that a molecule in green tea breaks apart tangles of the protein tau, which builds up in the brain due to Alzheimer\u2019s. Based on this finding, the team identified other potential Alzheimer\u2019s drug candidates. Another study, based on older adults\u2019 reports of their eating habits, found that eating a daily serving of leafy green vegetables such as spinach or kale was associated with slower age-related cognitive decline, perhaps due to the neuroprotective effects of certain nutrients.\n\nResearch has also shown that a diet that includes regular fish consumption is associated with higher cognitive function and slower cognitive decline with age. Another recent study, in mice, found that consuming too much salt increased levels of the protein tau, found in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s, and caused cognitive impairment.\n\n## What about vitamins and supplements?\n\nObservational study and clinical trial researchers have contemplated whether some over-the-counter vitamins and dietary supplements, including vitamins B and E and gingko biloba, might help prevent Alzheimer\u2019s or cognitive decline. The speculation is that these dietary add-ons might attack oxidative damage or inflammation, protect nerve cells, or influence other biological processes involved in Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nBut despite early findings of possible benefits for brain health, no vitamin or supplement has been proven to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s in people. Overall, evidence remains weak because many studies were too small or too brief to be conclusive.\n\nFor example, studies of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) in mice showed that this omega-3 fatty acid, found in salmon and certain other fish, reduced beta-amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s. However, clinical trials in humans have had mixed results. In a study of 485 older adults with age-related cognitive decline, those who took a DHA supplement daily for 24 weeks showed improved learning and memory compared to those who took a placebo. Another study of 4,000 older adults \u2014 conducted primarily to study eye disease \u2014 concluded that taking omega-3 supplements, alone or with other supplements, did not slow cognitive decline.\n\nAt this time, no vitamin or supplement is recommended for preventing Alzheimer\u2019s or cognitive decline. However, a 2023 study showed that multivitamins helped boost memory test scores in older adults compared to participants who took a placebo. Additionally, a 2022 study showed that participants who took a daily multivitamin did better on a wide range of cognitive tests, and had significant improvements in memory and executive function (attention, planning, and organization) compared to those who did not take a daily multivitamin. Even so, these findings are still preliminary and more research is needed.\n\nDespite ample availability, a broad range of other vitamins and supplements have not been tested for their effects on thinking. Their safety and effectiveness are largely unknown, and they may interact with other medications.\n\nFor more information, visit the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health\u2019s page on dietary supplements and cognitive function. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also has consumer information on diet and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThe connection between the digestive system and the brain\n\nThere is growing evidence for connections between the brain and the gut microbiome \u2014 the community of viruses, bacteria, and other microbes in the digestive system. NIA-funded investigators are analyzing how factors such as aging, diet, and the environment can change the conduit of neurons, proteins, and chemicals linking the digestive system and the brain, and how those changes may impact cognitive health.

            "## 3. Physical exercise and multimodal interventions for the treatment and prevention of AD\n\nDementia is by no means an inevitable consequence of reaching retirement age. There are lifestyle factors that may decrease, or increase, an individual's risk of developing dementia.22 Around 35% of dementia is attributable to a combination of 9 risk factors: low education level, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, hearing loss, later-life depression, diabetes, smoking, social isolation, and, of course, low physical activity.41\n\nA meta-analysis that included 16 studies with more than 160,000 participants found a 45% reduction in the risk of developing AD due to the regular practice of physical activity (hazard ratio\u202f=\u202f0.55, 95% confidence interval: 0.36\u22120.84, p\u202f=\u202f0.006).42 In a sample of 716 older subjects followed for 3.5 years, similar results were found when assessing the risk of suffering AD. Those individuals with low daily physical activity levels were 53% more likely to suffer AD than those who reported more active lives (hazard ratio\u202f=\u202f0.477, 95% confidence interval: 0.273\u22120.832).43\n\nAlthough there are discrepancies,36,44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49 the benefits of engaging in physical activities have also been seen in populations diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Several studies have found improvements in executive functions, memory, and cognitive tests in individuals with MCI who engaged in an aerobic exercise program.50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 Improvements in the cognitive function of individuals with MCI through physical activity are important in preventing the progression of the disease and in decreasing the number of AD in older people. In individuals diagnosed with AD, and, in general, at early stages of the disease, aerobic exercise alone, or accompanied with cognitive stimulation, induces improvements in some aspects of brain function,56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65 although in some studies exercise was accompanied with cognitive situation.\n\nFew studies have been published on the effects of resistance training in people with MCI or AD.44,66, 67, 68 Prominent among them is the randomized, double-blind trial that included 100 people between 55 and 86 years of age with MCI.69 In this study it was shown that 6 months of resistance exercise induced improvements in memory, attention, and executive functions. Moreover, those benefits persisted 12 months after the end of the intervention period.\n\nPrevention through the promotion of changes in lifestyle in presymptomatic and predementia disease stages may have the potential for delaying one-third of dementias.70 Engaging in physical exercise programs seems to be effective, but it is clearly not enough. Studies that examine multimodal interventions hypothesize that an integrated approach to addressing multiple risk factors for AD may be more successful than single-component interventions in producing benefits. Multimodal interventions often include changes in diet, physical activity, and cognitive training (Fig. 1).\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\nBrain function in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease is influenced by lifestyle factors. The usual trajectory for brain aging (orange line) indicates that, years before death, an individual shows signs of mild cognitive impairment. In some cases, that cognitive damage takes place many years before death and even leads to dementia (red line). By modifying lifestyle factors through multimodal interventions, an individual can delay the onset of cognitive impairment until a very advanced age (green line).\n\nSeveral studies attribute to the diet a key role in delaying the progression of AD. Some of these studies have tested diets considered as heart-healthy, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet (DASH), Mediterranean\u2013DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet (MIND), or the Mediterranean diet.71 The inflammatory component of AD has been treated by supplementation with fatty acids, vitamins, flavonoids, polyphenols, probiotics, and dietary advanced glycation end products.72 Ketogenic diets, which are protective in other neurological disorders, also seem to have great potential in the prevention and treatment of the disease.73 In humans, few clinical trials have been carried out using ketogenic diets; instead, ketogenic agents have been used.74 In animal models of AD, the increase in ketone levels in the body through intermittent fasting or supplementation with ketone esters have shown promising results.75,76\n\nThe Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), a multidomain intervention consisting of diet, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk monitoring, resulted in an improvement or maintenance of cognitive functioning in at-risk elderly people from the general population.77 This trial was the first methodologically robust study showing that with a 2-year intervention, it was possible to reduce the risk of cognitive decline among the general elderly population, rather than solely with patients in a clinical setting. More recently, it has been found that engaging in physical activity and lowering vascular risk may have additive protective effects on delaying the progression of AD.22 Greater physical activity and lower vascular risk independently attenuated the negative association of A\u03b2 burden with cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in asymptomatic individuals.78"

            "# Stay Mentally and Socially Active\n\nEmbrace lifestyle habits that improve your overall health, such as exercising, consuming a nutritious diet \u2014 and staying cognitively and socially active. Science suggests these may support brain health as well. It\u2019s never too late to make changes to achieve a healthier lifestyle \u2014 or too early to start.\n\nMental activities\n\nSocial activities\n\n## Mental activities\n\nMentally challenging activities, such as learning a new skill, adopting a new hobby or engaging in formal education, may have short and long-term benefits for your brain. To keep your mind active, it is important to participate in activities that expose your mind to new topics.\n\nChallenge yourself to games with strategy or high-level reading material, or determine how to approach a familiar task in a more effective way. Selecting activities you enjoy will increase the likelihood that you will continue to engage in them over time.\n\nAnother way to stay mentally active is to get as much formal education as you can, at any point in life. Formal education is classroom-based learning administered by professionally trained teachers. Engaging in this type of education will help keep your brain healthy and may protect your brain from developing dementia. This could involve taking a class at a local college or community center that teaches a new topic, skill or hobby (e.g., learning a language or how to play an instrument).\n\n## Social activities\n\nSocial engagement is associated with reduced rates of disability and mortality, and may also reduce risk for depression. Remaining socially active may support brain health and possibly delay the onset of dementia. There are many ways to stay socially active in your community, and these activities will provide the greatest connection to others.\n\nParticipation in clubs, volunteer efforts and other community pursuits may be valuable in maintaining your overall health. Many of these social activities are low-cost or free, such as joining a walking group or book club in your neighborhood. Staying socially active can also be as simple as engaging with friends and family on a regular basis.\n\nPursue social activities that are meaningful to you. For instance, if you love animals, consider volunteering at a local shelter or with a rescue group. Or, get involved with our cause to end Alzheimer\u2019s by becoming a volunteer or advocate, or participating in a community event."

            "# Alternative Treatments\n\nMore and more herbal remedies, dietary supplements, and \"medical foods\" are promoted as memory enhancers or treatments. Some even claim they can delay or prevent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. A growing body of evidence suggests that eating a healthy diet may lower the risk for cognitive decline and dementia. However, not a single food, beverage, ingredient, vitamin or supplement has been proven to prevent, treat or cure Alzheimer's disease or to benefit cognitive function or brain health.\n\r\nIn the United States, \"medical food\" can legally only refer to a food that treats a condition with a \"distinctive nutritional requirement.\" Alzheimer's does not have such a requirement, so no food can be labeled as a medicinal food for Alzheimer's.\n\r\nUnlike foods and drug products, dietary supplements do not go through the U.S. Food and Drug Adminsration's (FDA) rigorous review and regulation process. Because of this, consumers cannot be sure that the data, if any, behind claims about a supplement have been thoroughly reviewed and tested.\n\nConcerns about alternative therapies\n\nCaprylic acid and coconut oil\n\nCoenzyme Q10\n\nCoral calcium\n\nGinkgo biloba\n\nHuperzine A\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids\n\nPhosphatidylserine\n\nTramiprosate\n\n## Omega-3 fatty acids\n\nOmega-3 is a type of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). Research has linked certain types of omega-3s to a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nThe FDA permits supplements and foods to display labels with \u201ca qualified health claim\u201d for two types of omega-3 called docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The labels may state, \u201cSupportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease,\u201d and then list the amount of DHA or EPA in the product. The FDA recommends taking no more than a combined total of 3 grams of DHA or EPA a day, with no more than 2 grams from supplements.\n\nResearch has also linked high intake of omega-3s to a possible reduction in risk of dementia or cognitive decline. The chief omega-3 in the brain is DHA, which is found in the fatty membranes that surround nerve cells, especially at the microscopic junctions where cells connect to one another.\n\nTheories about why omega-3s might influence dementia risk include their benefit for the heart and blood vessels; anti-inflammatory effects; and support and protection of nerve cell membranes.\n\nTwo studies reported at the 2009 Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (AAICAD) found mixed results for the possible benefits of DHA:\n\nThe first study was a large federally funded clinical trial conducted by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS). In the ADCS study, participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease taking 2 grams of DHA daily fared no better overall than those who took a placebo (inactive, lookalike treatment). The data indicated a \"signal\" (preliminary but not conclusive evidence) that participants without the APOE-e4 Alzheimer's risk gene might have experienced a slight benefit. More research is needed to confirm whether that preliminary signal is valid.\n\nThe second study \u2014 Memory Improvement with DHA (MIDAS) \u2014 enrolled older adults with normal age-related cognitive decline. Those who took 900 milligrams of DHA daily scored slightly better on a computerized memory test than those receiving the placebo. MIDAS was conducted by Martek Biosciences, the manufacturer of the DHA used in both studies.\n\nExperts agree that more research is needed, and there is not yet sufficient evidence to recommend DHA or any other omega-3 fatty acids to treat or prevent Alzheimer's disease."
